"<p>Beginning with version 1.1.1, Audacity allows you to use the Nyquist "
"programming language to write your own plug-in effects for Audacity.  Unlike "
"VST and LADSPA plug-ins, Nyquist plug-ins can be written using an ordinary "
"text editor and don't need to be compiled.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist was written by <a href=\"http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/\">Roger B. "
"Dannenberg</a> and was intended to be used as a complete programming "
"language for audio synthesis and analysis, with support for MIDI, audio "
"recording and playback, file I/O, object-oriented programming, profiling, "

"process audio data.   Audacity doesn't include any support for debugging "
"Nyquist code, so if you are trying to write a complicated plug-in, you may "
"find it easier to get the full version of Nyquist and develop there, then "
"turn it into an Audacity plug-in.  Nyquist is available from the Carnegie "
"Mellon University Computer Music Project:</p>\n"

"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Note that you don't need to download Nyquist in order to write simple "
"plug-ins to use with Audacity.  All of the instructions you need are below.</"
"p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Lisp</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist is based on Lisp.  If you have programmed in Lisp before, you can "
"skim this section or go directly to the <a href=\"nyquist2\">next page</a>.  "
"Otherwise, here's an extremely brief introduction to Lisp:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Lisp (and therefore Nyquist), everything is an S-Expression, which is "
"just a list of tokens (words) separated by whitespace and enclosed in "
"parentheses.  The name of the function is always the first token in an S-"
"Expression, and all of the other tokens are arguments to this function.  "
"Here's a simple example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf area (* 3.14159 (expt radius 2)))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let's break down this example.  The outermost S-expression has three "
"members.  The first one, <code>setf</code>, is the name of the function (it "
"stands for set-field).  <code>setf</code> is used to assign a value to a "
"variable.  (There are other similar functions, like <code>set</code> and "
"<code>setq</code>, but <code>setf</code> is the most powerful, so it's the "
"one we'll use in our examples.) After <code>setf</code> comes <code>area</"
"code>, which is the name of the variable we're going to set.  Next comes the "
"value to assign to this variable, which in this case is another S-expression."
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lisp doesn't have any special operators for Math functions - they're all "
"functions like everything else, using <i>prefix</i> notation, where the name "
"of the function (or operator) come before its arguments.  So instead of 3*7 "
"for the product of 3 and 7, in Lisp you would write (* 3 7).  In Nyquist, "
"the <code>expt</code> (exponent) function raises its first argument to the "
"power of the second argument.  Therefore <code>(* 3.14159 (expt radius 2))</"
"code> means 3.14159 times the square of <code>radius</code>, or the formula "
"for the area of a circle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rather than typing in this full expression every time, let's define a "
"function for the area of the circle, that we can call every time we need it:"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (defun circlearea (radius) (* 3.14159 (expt radius 2)))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <code>defun</code> function is used to define a new function.  The "
"first argument is the name of the function, in this case <code>circlearea</"
"code>.  The second argument is a list of arguments to the function to be "
"defined - this is one of the few cases where you have an S-expression that "
"is not interpreted as a function call.  Finally the last expression is the "
"value of the function.  Now if we want to compute the area of a circle of "
"radius <code>r</code>, we just need to compute:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf area (circlearea r))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An S-expression is just a representation of a list.  Lisp uses lists to "
"represent just about everything (the name LISP comes from LISt Processing "
"language), so it's helpful to know how to manipulate lists.  Let's start by "
"assigning a list of numbers to a variable.  You can't quite do this:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf mylist (1 2 3 4 5))  <font color=#cc0000><--  error!</font>\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The reason this doesn't work is that whenever Nyquist sees an S-"
"expression, it tries to evaluate it as a function unless you tell it "
"otherwise.  Since there's no function named \"1\" that takes arguments <code>"
"(2 3 4 5)</code>, this will generate an error.  To tell lisp that you want "
"to treat an S-expression literally, and not to evaluate it as a function, "
"you <i>quote</i> it.  In Nyquist, you can quote a list by putting a single "
"quotation mark before it, like this:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf mylist '(1 2 3 4 5))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist also provides a <code>list</code> function that you can use to "
"construct lists - this is useful if some of the elements of the list are "
"functions:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf mylist (list 1 2 3 4 (sqrt 25)))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To get things off of a list, you can use the <code>first</code> and "
"<code>rest</code> functions.  (Traditionally, these were called <code>car</"
"code> and <code>cdr</code>, respectively, but <code>first</code> and "
"<code>rest</code> are much easier to remember.  Both sets of names are "
"supported in Nyquist.)  The output of <code>(first mylist)</code> is 1, and "
"the output of <code>(rest mylist)</code> is the list <code>(2 3 4 5)</"
"code>.  So the second element of the list is <code>(first (rest mylist))</"
"code>.</p>\n"

"\n"

"<b>Envelopes</b>\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist has support for envelopes.  By applying an envelope to a sound, "
"you can control the overall shape of its amplitude.  One of the easiest ways "
"to construct an envelope is with the <code>env</code> function, which takes "
"7 parameters that are commonly used for shaping synthesized musical notes: "
"attack time, decay time, release time, attack level, decay level, sustain "
"level, and overall duration.  See the figure below:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img alt=\"Nyquist envelope diagram.\" src=\"../images/nyquist-envelope\" "
"width=\"467\" height=\"200\"></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To apply an envelope to a sound, just use the <code>mult</code> "
"function.  So if <code>s</code> is a sound, then this is the sound with a "
"simple envelope applied to it:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (mult s (env 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.0 0.5 0.3 1.0))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One of the most general type of envelope is a piece-wise linear function, "
"which can be constructed with the <code>pwl</code> function.  The pwl "
"function takes a list of parameters which denote (time, value) pairs. There "
"is an implicit initial (time, value) pair of (0, 0), and an implicit final "
"value of 0. There should always be an odd number of parameters, since the "
"final time is not implicit.  For example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ; symmetric rise to 0.7 (at time 1) and fall back to 0 (at time 2):\n"
"  (pwl 1.0 0.7 2.0)\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Combining sounds</h3>\n"

"can add two sounds (or envelopes) with the <code>add</code> function.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Filters</h3>\n"

"<p>Nyquist comes with a number of common filters built-in.  Here are some of "
"the more common ones:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"function-list\">\n"
"\n"
"<tr>\n"
"<td>(lp sound cutoff)</td>\n"
"<td>Low-pass filter (first-order Butterworth). Cutoff may be a float or a "

"and Analyze plug-ins process audio but do not modify it (though they are "
"allowed to add labels).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For Effect and Analyze plug-ins, Audacity sets up the Nyquist environment "
"so that the audio the user has selected is in the variable <code>s</code>.  "
"All of the expressions in the plug-in file are executed in order, and the "
"return value of the last expression is substituted for the selection in "
"Audacity.  If the last expression does not return audio, Audacity returns an "
"error.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Parameter dialogs</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Audacity has limited support for plug-ins showing a dialog to get "
"parameters from the user.  Here is an example of a plug-in that opens a "
"dialog:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ;nyquist plug-in\n"
"  ;version 1\n"
"  ;type process\n"
"  ;name \"Delay...\"\n"
"  ;action \"Performing Delay Effect...\"\n"
"  ;info \"Demo effect for Nyquist by Roger Dannenberg.\\nThis effect \n"
"     creates a fixed number of echos.\"  ; (should be all on one line)\n"
"  ;control decay \"Decay amount\" int \"dB\" 6 0 24\n"
"  ;control delay \"Delay time\" real \"seconds\" 0.5 0.0 5.0\n"
"  ;control count \"Number of echos\" int \"times\" 5 1 30\n"
"\n"
"  (defun delays (s decay delay count)\n"
"    (if (= count 0) (cue s)\n"
"\t   (sim (cue s)\n"
"        (loud decay (at delay (delays s decay delay (- count 1)))))))\n"
"  (stretch-abs 1 (delays s (- 0 decay) delay count))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If Audacity finds at least one \"control\" line, it will open a dialog to "
"prompt the user for certain parameters to the plug-in.  Each parameter "
"consists of a text box and a slider, and after the user has entered each "
"one, the final value will be stored in a Nyquist variable with a name that "
"you specify on the \"control\" line.  Here's what the dialog for the Delay "
"effect shown above looks like in Audacity for Linux:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img alt=\"Nyquist plugin screenshot\" src=\"../images/nyquist-plugin-"
"screenshot\" width=\"414\" height=\"221\"></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Note that the \"info\" line is displayed at the top of the dialog, and "
"that the \"\\n\" becomes a newline.  The parameters to the \"control\" line "
"affect the appearance and limitations of the parameter.  Each \"control\" "
"line must consist of exactly the following 8 elements, in order:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ol>\n"
"\t<li>The word \"control\"</li>\n"
"\t<li>The name of the control - this is the name of the Nyquist variable "
"that will get set when the user manipulates the dialog.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The label to the left of the control</li>\n"
"\t<li>The type of value: either <code>int</code> (integer) or <code>real</"
"code>.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The label to the right of the value (usually the units like \"Hz\" or "
"\"dB\").</li>\n"
"\t<li>The default/initial value of the parameter</li>\n"
"\t<li>The minimum value of the parameter</li>\n"
"\t<li>The maximum value of the parameter</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Returning labels</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of returning audio, a Nyquist plug-in can instead return a list "
"of labels.  A list of labels is simply a list of time/label pairs, for "
"example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ((0.0 \"start\") (30.0 \"middle\") (60.0 \"end\"))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When a plug-in returns a list of exactly this form, Audacity will create "
"a new label track and add the labels at those positions.  This style of plug-"
"in is usually of type \"analyze\".</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>New!  Beginning with Audacity version 1.3.1, you can now optionally "
"return both a start and an end time, like this:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ((0.0 25.0 \"start\") (30.0 45.0 \"middle\") (60.0 75.0 \"end\"))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Note that labels are allowed to overlap in Audacity 1.3; the end time of "
"one can be after the start time of the next.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Processing stereo tracks</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist represents stereo tracks as an array of sounds (not a list).  "
"Many Nyquist functions automatically work with these arrays, but not all, so "
"sometimes you may find it necessary to split up a stereo array, or "
"reassemble one.  Here are some useful functions:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"function-list\">\n"
"<tr><td><code>(arrayp s)</code></td><td>returns true if <code>s</code> is an "
"array</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(aref s 0)</code></td><td>the first element in array <code>s</"
"code> - the left channel</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(aref s 1)</code></td><td>the second element in array <code>s</"
"code> - the right channel</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(setf s (make-array 2))</code></td><td>makes <code>s</code> "
"into a new array of length 2</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(setf (aref s 0) left)</code></td><td>makes <code>left</code> "
"the first element of array <code>s</code></td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(setf (aref s 1) right)</code></td><td>makes <code>right</"
"code> the second element of array <code>s</code></td></tr>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As a convenience, if the input to your Nyquist plug-in is stereo, but you "
"only output a single (mono) sound, Audacity will automatically copy it to "
"both the left and right channels.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Where to go from here</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Audacity comes with some sample plug-ins that you can examine or modify "
"as a starting point.  The best way to learn Nyquist is to try it.  If you're "
"having trouble debugging, consider downloading the standalone version of "
"Nyquist (see the link in Part 1).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you're having trouble getting Nyquist to work at all, please <a href="
"\"../contact/\">contact us</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you are working on Nyquist plug-in effects and would like to share "
"them with others, or if you would like to discuss general details of how to "
"achieve certain effects in Nyquist, please join the <a href=\"../contact/"
"lists#nyquist\">audacity-nyquist mailing list</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Don't forget to consult the full <a href=\"http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/"
"doc/nyquist/root.html\">Nyquist Reference Manual</a> for more details of how "
"Nyquist works.</p>"
