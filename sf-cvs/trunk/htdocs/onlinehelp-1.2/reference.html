<h2><a id="toolbar_mixer">Mixer Toolbar</a></h2>

<p>
<img src="images/toolbar_mixer.png" alt="Mixer Toolbar" />
<br/>
The Mixer Toolbar has three controls, used to set the volume levels of
your audio device and choose the input source.  The leftmost slider
controls the playback volume, the other slider controls the recording
volume, and the control on the right lets you choose the input
source (such as "Microphone", "Line In", "Audio CD", etc.). Use the
<a href="#toolbar_meter">Record Level Meter</a> to set the correct
level.
<br/>
Changing these controls has no effect on the audio data in your
project - in other words it doesn't matter what the output volume
level is when you Export or Save a project - the end result is the
same.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a id="toolbar_edit">Edit Toolbar</a></h2>
<p>
<img src="images/toolbar_edit.png" alt="Edit Toolbar" />
<br/>
All of the buttons on this toolbar perform actions - and with a couple of
exceptions, they're all just shortcuts of existing menu items to save you
time.
<br/>
Holding the mouse over a tool will show a "tooltip" in case you forget
which one is which.

<h2><a id="toolbar_meter">Meter Toolbar</a></h2>
<p>
<img src="images/toolbar_meter.png" alt="Meter Toolbar" />
<br/>
The Meter Toolbar is used for monitoring the input and output audio
levels.  Typically it is used to make sure that the loudest volume
is as loud as possible (for maximum fidelity) without clipping or 
distorting it. The output (playback) meter is the green one, on the
left in the picture above, and the input (recording) meter is in red,
on the right.</p>
<p>The meters provide a visual indication of the current audio levels going
in and out of audacity.</p>
<p>
If you float the Meter Toolbar, either by dragging it out of the toolbar
or by selecting "Float Meter Toolbar" from the View menu, you can resize it
and even orient it vertically.
</p>
<p>Normally the meters are only active when you are playing or recording audio.
However, you can also monitor input when you're not recording - to do this,
either select "Monitor Input" from the input meter's pop-up menu, or else
just click on the input meter.  If you have a microphone or other input
source attached, you will be able to watch the level of the audio before
you start recording.</p>
<p>Each meter shows several characteristics of the audio level at once:
<ul>
	<li>The right hand end of the meter corresponds to the point at
	which the audio will be clipped, and the left hand end is silence</li>
	<li>For stereo, the top bar shows the left channel, and the bottom
	bar shows the right channel.</li>
	<li>The brightest part of the bar shows the average audio
	level (related to the loudness) and the darker part of the 
	bar shows the peak audio level.</li>
	<li>The peak-hold line to the right of this shows the maximum
	audio level achieved in the last 3 seconds.</li>
	<li>Finally, the clipping indicators on the far right of
	each meter will light up if clipping is detected (meaning that
	the audio was too loud and will sound distorted).</li></ul>
<p>
If clipping is detected when you are recording, you should stop, lower
the volume of your input source, and start recording again from the start.
If the output meter clips then you need to make some or all of your tracks
quieter using the track <a href="#track_audio">gain control</a>.
<br>
If the level of the input (recording) source is too high, you can try
to lower the input level using the <a href="#toolbar_mixer">Mixer
Toolbar</a>, but if this doesn't work, you should try to lower the volume
of the external input source (e.g., your microphone, cassette player, or
record player).</p>

<p>It is possible, especially if you have an older, slower computer, that
the Meter Toolbar may interfere with Audacity's ability to record or play
audio with the highest quality, because your computer is so busy redrawing
the meters that it doesn't have time to process enough audio.  In this is the
case for you, you can disable the Meter Toolbar in the Interface tab of
the <a href="#prefs_ui">Preferences</a> dialog.</p>

<h1>Menu Bar</h1>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a></h2>

<p>
<img src="images/track-popdown.png" alt="Track Pop-Down Menu"/>
<br/>
The Track Pop-Down Menu appears when you click in a track's title.
This lets you access a few special commands that apply to individual
tracks.
</p>
<p><b>Name...</b> - lets you change the name of the track.
</p>
<p><b>Move Track Up</b> - exchange places with the track above this one.
</p>
<p><b>Move Track Down</b> - exchange places with the track below this one.
</p>
<p><b>Waveform</b> - sets the display to Waveform - this is the default way
   of visualizing audio.
   </p>
   <p><b>Waveform (dB)</b> - similar to Waveform, but on a logarithmic scale,
   measured in decibels (dB).
   </p>
   <p><b>Spectrum</b> - display the track as a spectrogram, showing the amount
   of energy in different frequency bands.
   </p>
   <p><b>Pitch (EAC)</b> - highlights the contour of the fundamental frequency
   (musical pitch) of the audio, using the Enhanced Autocorrelation
   (EAC) algorithm.
   </p>
   <p><b>Mono</b> - makes this track a mono track, meaning it is played out of
   just one speaker, or played out of the left and right speakers
   equally.
   </p>
   <p><b>Left Channel</b> - makes this track come out of only the left speaker.
   </p>
   <p><b>Right Channel</b> - makes this track come out of only the right speaker.
   </p>
   <p><b>Make Stereo Track</b> - if there is another track below this one,
   joins them to make a single stereo track, with the top track
   representing the left speaker, and the bottom track representing
   the right speaker.  When tracks are joined into a stereo pair,
   all edits automatically apply to both the left and right channel.
   </p>
   <p><b>Split Stereo Track</b> - if the selected track is a stereo track
   (a pair of left and right tracks joined together as a single track),
   this operation splits them into two separate tracks that you can
   modify and edit independently.
</p>
<p><b>Set Sample Format</b> - this determines the quality of the audio
   data and the amount of space it takes up. 16-bit is the quality used
   by audio CD's and is the minimum quality that Audacity uses internally
   (8-bit audio files are automatically converted when you open them). 
   24-bit is used in higher-end audio hardware. 32-bit <i>float</i> is the
   highest quality that Audacity supports, and it is recommended that you
   use 32-bit float unless you have a slow computer or are running out of
   disk space.
   </p>
   <p><b>Set Rate</b> - sets the number of samples per second of the track.
   44100 Hz is used by audio CDs.  Tracks can have different sample
   rates in Audacity; they are automatically resampled to the project
   sample rate (in the lower-left corner of the window).
   </p>
<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_file">File Menu</a></h2>
<p>
<b>New</b> - creates a new empty window
</p>

<p><b>Open...</b> - opens an audio file or an Audacity project in a new
window (unless the current window is empty).  To add audio files to
an existing project window, use one of the Import commands in the
<a href="#menu_project">Project</a> menu.
</p>

<p><b>Close</b> - closes the current window, asking you if you want to
save changes.  On Windows and Unix, closing the last window will
quit Audacity, unless you modify this behavior in the 
<a href="#prefs_ui">Interface</a> <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Save Project</b> - saves everything in the window into an
	Audacity-specific format so that you can save and quickly continue your
	work later.  An Audacity project consists of a project file, ending in
	<tt>".aup"</tt>, and a project data folder, ending in <tt>"_data"</tt>.
	For example, if you name your project "Composition", then Audacity will
	create a file called <tt>"Composition.aup"</tt> and a folder called 
	<tt>Composition_data</tt>.
	Audacity project files are not meant to be shared with other programs 
	- use one of the Export commands (below) when you are finished editing
	a file.
</p>

<p><b>Save Project As...</b> - same as Save Project (above), but lets you
save a project as a new name.
</p>

<p><b>Recent Files ...</b> - brings up a list of files you have recently 
opened in audacity to be re-opened quickly.</p>

<p><b>Export As WAV...</b> - exports all of the audio in your project as a
WAV file, an industry-standard format for uncompressed audio.  You can
change the standard file format used for exporting from Audacity by
opening the <a href="#prefs_fmt">File Format</a> <a href="#prefs">Preferences
</a>.
Note that exporting will automatically mix and resample if you have
more than one track, or varying sample rates.  See also
<a href="#fileformats">File Formats</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Export Selection As WAV...</b> - same as above, but only exports
the current selection.
</p>

<p><b>Export as MP3...</b> - exports all of the audio as an MP3 file.
MP3 files are compressed and therefore take up much less disk space,
but they lose some audio quality.  Another compressed alternative
is Ogg Vorbis (below).  You can set the quality of MP3 compression
in the <a href="#prefs_fmt">File Format</a> <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>.
See also<a href="#exportmp3">MP3 Exporting</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Export Selection As MP3...</b> - same as above, but only exports
the current selection.
</p>

<p><b>Export as Ogg Vorbis...</b> - exports all of the audio as an Ogg Vorbis
file.  Ogg Vorbis files are compressed and therefore take up much less
disk space, but they lose some audio quality.  Ogg Vorbis files tend to
take up a little less disk space than MP3 for similar compression quality,
and Ogg Vorbis is free from patents and licensing restrictions, but
Ogg Vorbis files are not as widespread.  You can set the quality of
Ogg compression in the <a href="#prefs_fmt">File Format</a> 
<a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Export Selection As Ogg Vorbis...</b> - same as above, but only exports
the current selection.
</p>

<p><b>Export Labels...</b> - if you have a 
	<a href="#track_label">Label Track</a> in your project, this lets
	you export the labels as a text file.  You can import labels in the
	same text format using the "Import Labels..." command in the
	<a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Export Multiple...</b> - lets you split your project into multiple files
all in one step.  You can either split them vertically (one new file per
track), or horizontally (using labels in a 
<a href="#track_label">Label Track</a> to indicate the breaks between
exported files.</p>


<p><b>Page Setup</b> - configure how Audacity will print out the track
waveforms using the Print option, and what printer to use.</p>

<p><b>Print</b> - Print out the main window view from audacity showing the
tracks and waveforms.</p>

<p><b>Exit (Quit)</b> - closes all windows and exits Audacity, prompting you
to save any unsaved changes first.
</p>


<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_edit">Edit Menu</a></h2>

<p><b>Undo</b> - This will undo the last editing operation you performed to your
project.  Audacity supports full unlimited undo - meaning
you can undo every editing operation back to when you opened the window.
</p>

<p><b>Redo</b> - This will redo any editing operations that were just undone.
After you perform a new editing operation,
you can no longer redo the operations that were undone.
</p>

<p><b>Cut</b> - Removes the selected audio data and places it on the clipboard.
Only one "thing" can be on the clipboard at a time, but it may
contain multiple tracks.
</p>

<p><b>Copy</b> - Copies the selected audio data to the clipboard without
removing it from the project.
</p>

<p><b>Paste</b> - Inserts whatever is on the clipboard at the position of the
selection or cursor in the project, replacing whatever audio data
is currently selected, if any.
</p>

<p><b>Trim</b> - Removes everything to the left and right of the selection.
</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Removes the audio data that is currently selected without
copying it to the clipboard.</p>

<p><b>Silence</b> - Erases the audio data currently selected, replacing it with
silence instead of removing it.</p>

<p><b>Split</b> - Moves the selected region into its own track or tracks,
replacing the affected portion of the original track with silence.
See the figure below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/split.png" style="border: 0"
	alt="Split function illustration"/>
</p>

<p><b>Duplicate</b> - Makes a copy of all or part of a track or set of tracks
into new tracks.  See the figure below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img style="border: 0" src="images/duplicate.png"
	alt="Duplicate function illustration"/>
	</p>
	<p><b>Select ... >  All</b> - Selects all of the audio in all of the
	tracks in the project.</p>

	<p><b>Select ... > Start to Cursor</b> - Selects from the beginning of
	the selected tracks to the cursor position.</p>

	<p><b>Select ... > Cursor to End</b> - Selects from the cursor position
	to the end of the selected tracks.</p>

<p><b>Find Zero Crossings</b> - Modifies the selection slightly so that both
the left and right edge of the selection appear on a positive-slope
zero crossing.  This makes it easier to cut and paste audio without resulting
in an audible clicking sound.</p>

<p><b>Selection Save</b> - Remembers the current selection (or cursor position),
allowing you to restore it later.</p>

<p><b>Selection Restore</b> - Restores the cursor position to the last position
saved by "Selection Save".</p>

<p><b>Move Cursor ... > to Track Start</b> - Moves the cursor to the start
	of the current track.</p>
	<p><b>Move Cursor ... > to Track End</b> - Move the cursor to the
	end of the currently selected track.</p>
	<p><b>Move Cursor ... > to Selection Start</b> - Moves the cursor
	to the start of the current selection.</p>
	<p><b>Move Cursor ... > to Selection End</b> - Moves the cursor to the
	end of the current selection.</p>

	<p><b>Snap-To ... > Snap On</b> - Enable Snap-To mode. When Snap-To
	mode is enabled, the selection will be
	constrained to the nearest interval on the time scale, by default the
	nearest second. So if you click and drag from 4.2 seconds to 9.8
	seconds, it will result in a selection from 4 seconds to 10 seconds,
	exactly.  You can change the units that are snapped to using the
	"Set Selection Format" option in the <a href="#menu_view">View Menu</a>
	.</p>

	<p><b>Snap-To ... > Snap Off</b> - Turns Snap-To mode off letting you
	select arbitrary ranges of time</p>
	
	<p><b>Preferences...</b> - opens the <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a>
	dialog.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_view">View Menu</a></h2>

<p><b>Zoom In</b> - Zooms in on the horizontal axis of the audio,
displaying more detail about less time.  You can also use the zoom
tool to zoom in on a particular part of the window.
</p>

<p><b>Zoom Normal</b> - Zooms to the default view, which displays about
one inch per second.</p>

<p><b>Zoom Out</b> - Zooms out, displaying less detail about more time.</p>

<p><b>Fit in Window</b> - Zooms out until the entire project just
fits in the window.</p>

<p><b>Fit Vertically</b> - Resizes all of the tracks vertically so they
all fit inside of the window (if possible).</p>

<p><b>Zoom to Selection</b> - Zooms in or out so that the selection fills
the window.</p>

<p><b>Set Selection Format</b> - lets you choose the formatting that is
displayed at the bottom of the window indicating the current selection
time.  Options include film, video, and audio CD frames, seconds + samples,
or pure time.  If you turn on Snap-To mode in the
<a href="#menu_edit">Edit Menu</a>, the selection will snap to the
frames or other quantization you have selected in this menu.</p>

<p><b>History...</b> - Brings up the history window.
It shows all the actions you have performed during the current session,
including importing.  The right-hand column shows the amount of hard disk
space your operations used.  You can jump back and forth between editing
steps quite easily by simply clicking on the entries in the window, the
same as selecting Undo or Redo many times in a row.  You can also discard
Undo history to save disk space.
The history window can be kept open while you work.</p>


<p><b>Float Control Toolbar</b> - moves the
<a href="#toolbar_control">Control Toolbar</a> out of the window and
into its own
floating window, so you can position it wherever you want.  The menu
item changes to <b>Dock Control Toolbar</b>, which you can use to
put the toolbar back into the main window.</p>

<p><b>Float Edit Toolbar</b> - moves the
<a href="#toolbar_edit">Edit Toolbar</a> out of the window and into its own
floating window, so you can position it wherever you want.  The menu
item changes to <b>Dock Edit Toolbar</b>, which you can use to
put the toolbar back into the main window.</p>

<p><b>Float Meter Toolbar</b> - does the same thing for audacity's 
<a href="#toolbar_meter">VU meters</a> which you use to set recording levels
and adjust playback.</p>

<p><b>Float Mixer Toolbar</b> - moves the
<a href="#toolbar_mixer">Mixer Toolbar</a> out of the
window and into its own floating window as above.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_project">Project Menu</a></h2>

<p><b>Import Audio...</b> - 
This command is used to import audio from a standard audio format into
your project.  Use this command if you already have a couple of tracks
and you want to add another track to the same project, maybe to mix
them together.
You cannot use this option to import Audacity Projects.  The only way
to combine two Audacity Projects is to open them in separate windows,
then copy and paste the tracks.
</p>

<p><b>Import Labels...</b> - 
This command takes a text file which contains time codes and labels,
and turns them into a <a href="#track_label">Label Track</a>.</p>

<p><b>Import MIDI...</b> - 
This menu command imports MIDI files and puts them into a 
<a href="#track_midi">MIDI Track</a>.  Audacity can display
MIDI files, but <i>cannot play, edit, or save them yet.</i></p>

<p><b>Import Raw Data...</b> - 
This menu command allows you to open a file in virtually any
uncompressed format.  When you select the file,
Audacity will analyze it and try to guess its format.
It will guess correctly about 90% of the time, so you can try just
pressing "OK" and listening to the result.  If it is not correct, however,
you can use the options in the dialog to try some other possible
encodings.<br/>

At the beginning of your imported track(s), you may notice a little
bit of noise.  This is probably the file's header, which Audacity
was not able to parse.  Just zoom in and select the noise with the
<a href="#toolbar_control">Selection Tool</a>, and then
choose Delete from the <a href="#menu_edit">Edit Menu</a>.</p>

<p><b>Edit ID3 Tags...</b> - 
Opens a dialog allowing you to edit the ID3 tags associated with
a project, for MP3 exporting.
</p>

<p><b>Quick Mix</b> - 
This command mixes all of the selected tracks together.  If you are
mixing stereo tracks, or mixing tracks that are marked as Left or
Right channel, the result will be a stereo track (two channels), otherwise
the result will be mono.
<br/>
Your tracks are implicitly mixed whenever you hit the Play
button and whenever you export. This command offers a way to do it
permanently and
save the results to disk, saving on playback resources.<br/>
Note that if you try to mix two very loud tracks together, you may
get clipping (it will sound like pops, clicks, and noise).
To avoid this, drag the gain slider on the tracks down to reduce their
volume before mixing.
</p>

<p><b>New Audio Track</b> - 
This creates a new empty <a href="#track_audio">Audio Track</a>.
This command is rarely needed,since importing, recording, and mixing
automatically create new tracks
as needed.  But you can use this to cut or copy data from an existing
track and paste it into a blank track.
If that track was at a non-default rate then you may need to use Set Rate
from the <a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down</a> menu to set the correct
sample rate.
</p>

<p><b>New Stereo Track</b> - same as above, but creates a stereo track.
You can also create a stereo track by joining two tracks using the
<a href="#menu_track">track pop-down</a> menu.</p>

<p><b>New Label Track</b> - 
This creates a new <a href="#track_label">Label Track</a>,
which can be very useful for textual annotation.</p>

<p><b>New Time Track</b> - 
This creates a new <a href="#track_time">Time Track</a>,
which is used to vary the speed of playback over time.
</p>

<p><b>Remove Tracks</b> - 
This command removes the selected track or tracks from the project.
Even if only part of a track is selected, the entire track is removed.
You can also delete a track by clicking the X in its upper-left corner.
To cut out only part of the audio in a track, use
<a href="#menu_file">Delete</a> or 
<a href="#menu_file">Silence</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Align Tracks...</b> - 
All the Align functions work on whole tracks or groups of tracks,
not on selections, even if they span across multiple tracks.
They all operate by time-shifting tracks (moving them left or
right), making it easier to synchronize tracks or get rid of silence
at the beginning.  The cursor or selection stays in the same place
unless you use "Align and move cursor...", below:</p>

<p><b>Align and move cursor...</b> - same as the functions above, except
that the cursor or selection is moved along with the tracks.  That
allows you to shift the tracks without losing your relative place.
</p>

<p><b>Add Label at Selection</b> - 
This menu item lets you create a new label at the current selection.
You can title the label by typing with the keyboard and then hitting "Enter"
when you're done.</p>
<p><b>Add Label at Playback Position</b> - 
This menu item lets you create a new label at the current location where
you are playing or recording.  Do this if you want to mark a certain
passage while you're listening to it.  You can title the label by typing
with the keyboard and then hitting "Enter" or "Return" when you're done.
Only available whilst audacity is playing.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_generate">Generate Menu</a></h2>

<p>If you choose an item from the Generate menu when there are no tracks 
in a project, a new track is created. Otherwise, the current track is used.
<br/>
If a track is selected and the cursor is placed in a single place
in the track audio is inserted at the cursor position. The default duration 
is 30 seconds.<br/>

The audio created will replace the any selection, otherwise it is inserted into
the track, shifting up later parts of the track.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%"/>

<p><b>Silence</b> - inserts silence
</p>

<p><b>Tone...</b> - you can create a Sine wave, Square wave, or Sawtooth wave.
</p>

<p><b>White Noise</b> - inserts random audio samples, which sounds like
pure static.</p>

<p>Any items which appear after these three built-ins are VST,
Ladspa, or Nyquist plug-ins.  It is possible for a poorly written
plug-in to crash Audacity, so always save your work before using a
plug-in.  Note that any effect that doesn't take any audio as input
will automatically be placed in the Generate menu.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_effect">Effect Menu</a></h2>

<p>The items in this menu only work when you have audio selected.
Audacity does not have any real-time effects; you must select the
audio, apply the effect, and then listen to the results.<br/>
Most effects have a Preview button.  Clicking on this button plays
up to three seconds of audio, allowing you to hear what it will sound
like after the effect is applied.  This is useful for fine-tuning the
effect parameters.</p>

<p><b>Repeat Last Effect</b> - selecting this command is a shortcut to
applying the most recent effect with the same settings.  This is a
convenient way to quickly apply the same effect to many different parts of
a file.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%"/>
<p><b>Amplify</b> - changes the volume of the selected audio.  If you
click the "Allow clipping" checkbox, it will let you amplify
so much that the audio ends up beyond the range of the waveform, and is 
clipped (distorted). The
default value when you open the effect is to amplifiy so that the loudest
part of the selection is as loud as possible without distortion.
</p>

<p><b>Bass Boost</b> - enhances the bass frequencies in the audio.</p>

<p><b>Change Pitch</b> - changes the pitch/frequency of the selected audio
without changing the tempo.  When you open the dialog, the starting
frequency is set to Audacity's best guess as to the frequency of the
selection.  This works well for recordings of singing or musical
instruments without background noise.  You can specify the pitch change
in one of four different ways: musical note, semitones, frequency, or
percent change.</p>

<p><b>Change Speed</b> - changes the speed of the audio by resampling.
Making the speed higher will also increase the pitch, and vice versa.
This will change the length of the selection.</p>

<p><b>Change Tempo</b> - changes the tempo (speed) of the audio without
changing the pitch.  This will change the length of the selection.</p>

<p><b>Compressor</b> - compresses the dynamic range of the selection so
that the loud parts are softer while keeping the volume of the soft
parts the same.  You can optionally normalise the recording afterwards,
resulting in the entire piece having higher perceived volume.</p>

<p><b>Echo</b> - very simple effect that repeats the selection with a
decay, sounding like a series of echos.  This effect does not change
the length of the selection, so you may want to add silence to the end
of the track before applying it (using the
<a href="#menu_generate">Generate Menu</a>).</p>

<p><b>Equalization</b> - Boost or reduce arbitrary frequencies.  You can
select one of a number of different curves designed to equalize the
sound of some popular record manufacturers, or draw your own curve.</p>

<p><b>Fade In</b> - fades the selection in linearly</p>

<p><b>Fade Out</b> - fades the selection out linearly</p>

<p><b>FFT Filter</b> - similar to Equalization, lets you enhance or reduce
arbitrary frequencies.  The curve here uses a linear scale for
frequency.</p>

<p><b>Invert</b> - Flips the waveform vertically,  the same as a phase
inversion in the analogue domain.</p>

<p><b>Noise Removal</b> - This effect lets you clean up noise from a recording.
First, select a small piece of audio that is silent except for the noise,
select "Noise Removal", and click on the "Get Noise Profile" button.
Then select all of the audio you want filtered select "Noise Removal"
again, and click the "Remove Noise" button.  You can experiment with
the slider to try to remove more or less noise.  It is normal for
Noise Removal to result in some distortion.  It works best when the
audio signal is much louder than the noise.</p>

<p><b>Normalize</b> - allows you to correct for DC offset (a vertical
displacement of the track) and/or amplify such that the maximum
amplitude is a fixed amount, -3 dB.  It's useful to normalize all
of your tracks before mixing. If you have a lot of tracks, you may then
need to use the track gain sliders to turn some down. </p>

<p><b>Nyquist Prompt</b> - for advanced users only.  Allows you to
express arbitrary transormations using a powerful functional
programming language.  See the Nyquist section of the Audacity
website for more information.</p>

<p><b>Phaser</b> - the name "Phaser" comes from "Phase Shifter", because it
works by combining phase-shifted signals with the original
signal.  The movement of the phase-shifted signals is
controlled using a Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO).</p>

<p><b>Repeat</b> - repeats the selection a certain number of times.
This operation is quite fast and space-efficient, so it is practical
to use it to create nearly-infinite loops.</p>

<p><b>Reverse</b> - This effect reverses the selected audio temporally;
after the effect the end of the audio will be heard first and the
beginning last.</p>

<p><b>Wahwah</b> - uses a moving bandpass filter to create its
sound.  A low frequency oscillator (LFO) is used to
control the movement of the filter throughout the
frequency spectrum.  Adjusts the phase of the left and right
channels when given a stereo selection, so that the effect seems
to travel across the speakers.</p>

<p><b>Plugins 1 to 15 ...</b> etc. These submenus contain any 
VST, Ladspa, or Nyquist plug-ins loaded by audacity.
It is possible for a poorly written
plug-in to crash Audacity, so always save your work before using a
plug-in effect.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="menu_analyze">Analyze Menu</a></h2>

<p><b>Plot Spectrum</b> -
To use this feature, first select a region of audio from a single
track, then select "Plot Spectrum".
It opens up a window that
displays the Power Spectrum of the audio over that region, calculated
using the Fast Fourier Transform.  The graph represents how much
energy is in each frequency.  As you move the mouse over the display,
it shows you the nearest peak frequency.
This window can also display other common
functions that are calculated using the Fast Fourier Transform, including
three versions of the Autocorrelation function.
The Enhanced Autocorrelation function is very good at identifying the
pitch of a note.</p>
<hr style="width: 50;"/>
<p>The Analyze menu is intended for effects and plug-in effects that
do not modify the audio, but simply open a dialog with some
descriptive information.  Audacity also supports Analyze commands that
create annotations in a <a href="#track_label">Label Track</a>.</p>

<h1>Tracks</h1>

<h2><a id="track_audio">Audio Track</a></h2>
<p><img src="images/track.png" alt="Audio Track Image"/></p>

<hr style="width: 50%"/>

<h3>Waveform display</h3>

<p><img src="images/track-waveform.png" alt="Waveform Display"/></p>

<p>This is the waveform display part of the track, although it is also
possible to display a spectrogram instead of a waveform here.<br/>
This image shows a stereo track, which is a group of two tracks - the
top one is for the left channel, and the bottom one is for the right
channel.  If you need to edit the two channels as separate tracks,
you can split them using the <a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>.
</p>

<hr style="width: 50%"/>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<p><img src="images/track-label.png" alt="Track Control Image"/></p>
<p>The track Control Panel appears directly to the left of every track.
Clicking in the panel outside of one of its buttons or controls selects the
entire track.  Shift-clicking a track label adds or removes that
track from the selection.  Also, clicking and dragging a track label
is one way to rearrange the order of tracks.<br/>
At the top-left of the label is the close box.  Click here to
delete the track (though you can Undo this operation).<br/>
To the right of the close box is the track's title.  Clicking on the
title brings up the <a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>,
allowing you to rearrange tracks and change various track options:</p>
<p>
The next line in the label tells you the channel of the track
(left, right, mono, or stereo) and the sample rate (e.g. 44100 Hz is
the audio CD rate).  Beneath that is the quality - 32-bit float is
high quality but takes up more disk space, and 16-bit is the same
quality as an audio CD.<br/>
The Mute button stops this track from playing.  The Solo button
plays only this track (or other solo tracks) and overrides the
Mute button.  Muting and soloing doesn't affect mixing or exporting,
just playback within Audacity.<br/>
The top slider is the gain control - it affects the relative volume
of the track.  By default it only lets you select multiples of 3 dB,
but if you hold down shift you can choose any level.  Be careful not
to set it too high, or you can exceed the maximum volume of a track,
which results in clipping.<br/>
The bottom slider is the pan control - it affects the balance between
the left and right speakers.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%"/>

<h3>Vertical Ruler</h3>
<p><img src="images/track-vruler.png" alt="Track Vertical Ruler"/></p>

<p>The Vertical Ruler is a guide to the levels you see in the waveforms.
A level of 1.0 or -1.0 is the maximum supported by the audio file -
anything beyond these levels will be clipped, which can sound like
distortion.
<br/>
When the mouse is over the vertical ruler, it changes to a magnifying
glass.  By clicking, you can zoom in vertically, and by shift-clicking
(or right-clicking) you can zoom back out.  You can zoom out as much as
a factor of 2, which can be useful for editing envelopes.
<br/>
When zooming vertically, Audacity will automatically "snap" to the
normal range of -1...1 when you get close.  If you are having trouble
resetting the vertical ruler, shift-click a bunch of times until the
range is -2...2, then click once to zoom back to -1...1.</p>
<p>If you change the display on the <a href="#menu_track">
	Track Pop-Down menu</a> then the units of the vertical scale
will change to reflect this.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="track_label">Label Track</a></h2>
<p><img src="images/labeltrack_1.png" alt="Label Track Image"/></p>
<p>Label Tracks can be used to annotate an audio file.  They can be used
for lyrics, markers, or notes, and they can even be used to save
selections.</p>

<p>To create a Label Track, select New Label Track from the
<a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>.  Alternatively, simply
click or select where you would like to place a label, and choose
Add Label at Selection from the <a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>,
and a Label Track will be created automatically if one doesn't already
exist.<br/>
To add a new label, click or select where you want the new label to appear,
then select Add Label at Selection from the
<a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>, then type the name of the
label, and finally press Enter or click outside of the label.</p>

<p>In addition, you can use the Add Label at Playback Position command
from the <a href="menu_project.htm">Project Menu</a> if you want to
add a label at a certain place while you are listening.  By default, this
command has a shortcut of Control+M.
</p>


<p>To edit the name of a label, click anywhere in it.
Zoom in first if there are too many labels crowded together and you
are unable to click on the one you want.  When a label is selected
for editing, it looks like the first label below:<br/>
<img src="images/labeltrack_2.png" alt="Labels on the track"/>
<br/>
When editing the name of a label, you are limited to using just
the backspace key for editing.  There is currently no way to move the
insertion point to append a letter to the beginning of a label.</p>

<p>Once a label is selected, you can move to the next label by pressing
Tab, and move to the previous label by pressing Shift-Tab.<br/>
To delete a label or multiple labels, select the area containing the
label flags you wish to delete, and choose Silence from the
<a href="#menu_edit">Edit Menu</a>.  Alternatively you can delete
an individual label by clicking on it and pressing Backspace until you
have deleted all of the characters in the label, then pressing Enter.<br/>

To move labels, use the normal editing commands like Cut, Copy,
Paste, Delete, and Silence.</p>

<p>You can save a selection in a label.  When you create a new
label, the left selection edge determines the position of the label's
flag.  However, the right selection edge is also stored in the label,
and when you click on it, the full original selection will be restored.
If you wish to apply this selection to only a subset of the tracks,
shift-click in the label area to the left of each track's waveform
to change whether each track is part of the selection or not.</p>

<h3>Exporting and Importing label tracks</h3>

<p>Label Tracks are saved when you save an Audacity Project, so if you
just want to continue using the labels along with the same file,
just save a project.  But you can also export the labels to a simple
text file, and import them.  This allows you to save information about
the locations of events in an audio file for use in another program,
and also provides a way to mass-edit the labels if necessary.<br/>

To export a Label Track, choose Export Labels... from the
<a href="#menu_file">File Menu</a>.  The exported file will
contain one line per label, starting with the time offset in
seconds, then a tab, and then the name of the label, for example:
</p>
<pre>
1.217995    Bass intro
3.921073    Guitar enters
7.584454    Drums enter
11.070002   Chorus
</pre>
<p>
To import a Label Track, choose Import Labels... from the
<a href="#menu_file">File Menu</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="track_time">Time Track</a></h2>
<p>The Time Track is a new feature that lets you change
the rate of playback over time.  Start by choosing
New Time Track from the <a href="#menu_project">Project Menu</a>.
Then change the range of time warping by clicking on the
<a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a> and choosing
Set Range (an option which only appears for Time Tracks).
Older computers may be incapable of playing audio in real-time
that makes use of a Time Track, however you can always Export the
file as a WAV and then playback the WAV file later.</p>

<p>To edit the time warping, choose the envelope tool from the
<a href="#toolbar_control">Control Toolbar</a> - the same tool
you use to edit amplitude envelopes in Audio Tracks.  Click to
create and edit control points.  Drag points off-screen to
delete them.<br/>
The Time Track has a ruler.  As you edit the warping, the ruler will
warp to show you at what time playback will reach each place in the
audio.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="track_midi">MIDI Track</a> (incomplete)</h2>
<p>Audacity currently supports displaying MIDI files if you import
them using Import MIDI in the Project menu.<br/>
Audacity does not support playing, recording, or editing MIDI files.
It does not even support saving MIDI Tracks in a project file.
<br/>
The current functionality is useful to only a small group of people who
are studying algorithms that relate MIDI data to audio data and simply
wish to see the visual representation of the MIDI data and how it lines
up with the audio data.</p>

<hr/>
<h1>Other</h1>

<h2><a id="prefs">Preferences</a></h2>
<h3>Audio I/O</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Playback Device</b> - Use this control to select the device
    that will be used for playback / audio output.  This is usually
    only applicable if your computer has more than one sound card.
    </li>

<li><b>Recording Device</b> - Select the devce that will be used
    for recording / audio input.  Note that many devices have
    multiple <i>sources</i> such as Microphone and Line in - to
    select the input source you will need to use the 
    <a href="#toolbar_mixer">Mixer Toolbar</a>.<br/>
    For finer control over audio I/O, open your system's Sound
    control panel or the control panel software that came with your
    sound card.</li>

<li><b>Recording Channels</b> - Use this to select the number of
    channels to record simultaneously.  Select 1 for mono and
    2 for stereo.  Audacity will support recording more simultaneous
    channels, but note that most sound cards only support stereo, and
    even if your sound card supports more than 2 inputs, you need a
    fast computer and a large, fast hard disk to record many channels
    for a long time.<br/>
    Mono recording is not the same on all computers or sound cards.
    Sometimes recording mono only records the left channel, and sometimes
    it mixes the left and right channels.</li>

<li><b>Play other tracks while recording new one</b> - 
    When this box is checked, Audacity will play existing tracks
    when you press record - otherwise it simply records the new
    track without letting you hear what you've already recorded.
    You can use this option to record harmonies with yourself or
    add a voiceover.<br/>
    You may notice that when you play the two tracks you recorded
    together, they aren't synchronized.  This is unavoidable to a
    certain extent, although Audacity tries to minimize it. 
    To fix it, you will need to grab the
    <a href="#toolbar_control">Time Shift</a> tool and slide one
    of the tracks around until it sounds right.</li>
    <li><b>Hardware Playthrough</b> (Mac Only) - plays the audio you are
    recording straight back out to your headphones or speakers so you can
    hear it. This option is done in harware, so it is fast and doesn't
    consume resources. However, it is only possibly if input and output
    are on the same sound device.
    <br/>PC users can do the same thing in their volume control
    settings, turning up the relevant audio input.</li>
    <li><b>Software Playthrough</b> - Does the same thing as hardware
    playthrough, but in software. This means that the audio you hear may be
    slightly delayed relative to the input, and activating this option
    will use some more system resources. However, it works on all systems, 
    even if you are recording from one device and playing back through
    another.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="prefs_qual">Quality</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Default Sample Rate</b> - This controls the sample rate of new
    projects.  To change the sample rate of an existing project,
    use the control in the lower-left corner of the main project window.
    </li>

<li><b>Default Sample Format</b> - This controls the default format used
    to store audio samples.  16-bit takes up the least space and is
    equivalent to audio CD quality.  32-bit float takes up twice as
    much space but is much more flexible.<br/>
    If you have a fast computer and enough disk space, you should always
    use 32-bit float samples while editing, and then export your final
    mix as a 16-bit WAV file (the default).
    </li>

<li><b>Real-time sample rate converter</b> - Audacity has more than one
    sample rate converter that's used when you have a track that's not
    the same sample rate as the project.  This option lets you set the
    converter used during real-time playback, which can be different than
    the one you use during Export or mixing.</li>

<li><b>High-quality sample rate converter</b> - Audacity has more than one
    sample rate converter that's used when you have a track that's not
    the same sample rate as the project.  This option lets you set the
    converter used during Export and mixing, which can be different than
    the one you use for real-time playback.</li>

<li><b>Real-time dither</b> - Dithering is used when converting
    high-quality samples with a lot of dynamic range, to CD-quality
    samples, with less dynamic range.  A small amount of dithering
    can make the audio sound a little bit better, but it can also
    slow down processing a little bit.  This option lets you set the
    dithering used for real-time playback.</li>

<li><b>High-quality dither</b> - Dithering is used when converting
    high-quality samples with a lot of dynamic range, to CD-quality
    samples, with less dynamic range.  A small amount of dithering
    can make the audio sound a little bit better, but it can also
    slow down processing a little bit.  This option lets you set the
    dithering used during Export and mixing.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a id="prefs_fmt">File Formats</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>When importing uncompressed audio files into Audacity</b>

   <ul>
   <li><b>Make a copy of the file before editing (safer)</b> -
       Selecting this means that Audacity will take longer to
       import files, but it will always have its own copy of any
       audio you are using in a project.  You can move, change,
       or throw away your files immediately after you open or
       import them into Audacity.</li>

   <li><b>Read directly from the original file (faster)</b> -
       Selecting this means 
       that Audacity depends on your original audio files
       being there, and only stores changes you make to these
       files.  If you move, change, or throw away one of the files
       you imported into Audacity, your project may become
       unusable.  However, because Audacity doesn't need to
       make copies of everything first, it can import files
       in much less time.</li></ul></li>

<li><b>Uncompressed Export Format</b> - This lets you select the
    format that Audacity will use when you export uncompressed
    files.  11 common options are displayed in the list, but you 
    can also select "Other" and choose a nonstandard file format
    for Audacity to export.</li>

<li><b>Ogg Export Setup</b> - Use this control to set the
    quality of Ogg Vorbis exporting.  Ogg Vorbis is a compressed
	 audio format similar to MP3, but free of patents and
	 licensing fees.  A normal quality Ogg Vorbis file is
	 encoded with a quality setting of "5".  Note that unlike
	 MP3 encoding, Ogg Vorbis does not let you set a bitrate,
	 because some audio clips are easier to compress than
	 others.  Increasing the quality will always increase the
	 file size, however.</li>

<li><b>MP3 Export Setup</b> - Use these controls to locate your
    MP3 encoder and set the quality of MP3 encoding.  Higher
    quality files take up more space, so you will need to find
    the level of quality you feel is the best compromise.
    For more information, see
    <a href="#exportmp3">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a id="prefs_spec">Spectrograms</a></h3>

<p>You can view any audio track as a Spectrogram instead of a
Waveform by selecting one of the Spectral views from the
<a href="#menu_track">Track Pop-Down Menu</a>.
This dialog lets you adjust some of the settings for these spectrograms.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>FFT Size</b> - The size of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    affects how much vertical (frequency) detail you see.  Larger
    FFT sizes give you more bass resolution and less temporal (timing)
    resolution, and they are slower.</li>

<li><b>Grayscale</b> - Select this for gray spectrograms instead of
colored ones.</li>

<li><b>Maximum Frequency</b> - Set this value anywhere from a couple
    of hundred hertz to half the sample rate (i.e. 22050 Hz if the
    sample rate is 44100 Hz).  For some applications, such as speech
    recognition or pitch extraction, very high frequencies are not
    important (visually), so this allows you to hide these and only
    focus on the ones you care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="prefs_dir">Directories</a></h3>

<p>Use this panel to set the location of Audacity's temporary
   directory (folder).  Audacity uses this directory whenever
   you work on a project that you haven't saved as an Audacity Project
   (AUP file) yet.
   You have to restart Audacity (close and open it again) for
   changes to the temporary directory to take effect.
</p>

<h3><a id="prefs_ui">Interface</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Autoscroll while playing</b> - Scrolls the window for you
    while playing, so that the playback cursor is always in the window.
    This can hurt playback performance on slower computers.</li>

<li><b>Always allow pausing</b> - Normally the Pause button is only
    enabled while you are playing or recording.  Checking this box
    allows you to set the pause button anytime, which allows you
    to press Record and not have the recording start until you
    unpause it.  Sometimes starting a paused recording can be faster
    than starting to record in the first place.</li>

<li><b>Update spectrogram while playing</b> - Because spectrograms are
    slower to draw, normally they are not drawn during playback, but this
    option lets you draw the spectrograms anyway.</li>

<li><b>Enable Edit Toolbar</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display
    the <a href="#toolbar_edit">Edit Toolbar</a>, which has some
    common shortcuts for editing commands.</li>

<li><b>Enable Mixer Toolbar</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display
    the <a href="#toolbar_mixer">Mixer Toolbar</a>, which lets you
    set the volume levels and input source.</li>
<li><b>Enable Meter Toolbar</b> - Sets whether or not you want to display
the <a href="#toolbar_meter">Meter Toolbar</a> for setting audio recording
and playback levels.</li>

<li><b>Quit Audacity upon closing last window</b> - By default on Windows
    and X-Windows (but not Mac OS), Audacity quits when you close the
    last project window.  If you uncheck this box, Audacity will open a
    new blank document instead of quitting.  To quit Audacity in this case,
    you must specifically select Exit (or Quit) from the File menu.
    </li>

<li><b>Enable dragging of left and right selection edges</b> - Normally,
   when you move the mouse over the left and right edge of a selection,
   the cursor changes to a left or right pointer, and you can adjust
   that edge of the selection independently.  If you don't like this
   feature, uncheck this box, and then clicking will always create
   a new selection (unless you hold down Shift to extend an existing
   selection).</li>

<li><b>Language</b> - sets the language used by Audacity.  Language
    files are named "audacity.mo" and are found in the "Languages"
    folder on Windows and Mac OS X, or in /usr/share/locale or
    /usr/local/share/locale on most Unix systems.  Audacity will detect
    new languages the next time you start it.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="prefs_kbd">Keyboard</a></h3>

<p>This panel lets you change keyboard shortcuts.  All of the commands
that appear in Audacity menus appear on the left, along with a few
other buttons that can get keyboard shortcuts.  To change a command,
first click on the command you want to change.  Then type the new
keyboard shortcut on your keyboard.  Verify that the correct shortcut
appears in the box below.  If it's what you want, press the <b>Set</b>
button.  Or to get rid of a keyboard shortcut, press <b>Clear</b>.
<br/>
To reset to Audacity's defaults, press the <b>Defaults</b> button.
This will get rid of any changes you have made.
<br/>
If you have customized your keyboard layout and want to share it
with someone else, you can press <b>Save...</b> and save your complete
keyboard layout as an XML file that you can share.  To load an existing
layout, press the <b>Load...</b> button and locate the XML file.
</p>

<h3><a id="prefs_ms">Mouse</a></h3>

<p>This panel doesn't let you change anything, but it lets you view
all of the commands and actions that you can do using the mouse,
many by holding down extra modifier keys.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="fileformats">Sound File Formats</a></h2>
<h3>Audacity Project format (AUP)</h3>

<p>Audacity projects are stored in an AUP file, which is a format that
has been highly optimized for Audacity so that it can open and save
projects quickly.  In order to achieve this speed, Audacity
breaks larger audio files into several smaller pieces and stores these
pieces in a directory with a similar name as the project.
For example, if you name a project "chanson", then Audacity will create a
project file called <tt>chanson.aup</tt> to store the general
information about your project, and it will store your audio in several
files inside a directory called <tt>chanson_data</tt>.
While the Audacity Project format is based on XML and is meant to be
open, it is not currently compatible with any other audio
programs, so when you are finished working on a project and you
want to be able to edit the audio in another program, select
Export from the <a href="#menu_file">File Menu</a>.
</p>

<h3>WAV (Windows Wave format)</h3>

<p>This is the default uncompressed audio format on Windows, and is supported
on almost all computer systems.  Audacity can read and write this format.
People working with multichannel audio at very high quality settings, or with
very long recordings, should note that the maximum size of a wav file is
2GB.</p>

<h3>AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)</h3>

<p>This is the default uncompressed audio format on the Macintosh, and it
is supported by most computer systems, but it is not quite as common as
the WAV format.  Audacity can read and write this format.</p>

<h3>Sun Au / NeXT</h3>

<p>This is the default audio format on Sun and NeXT computers, and
usually u-law compressed, so it is not a very high quality
format.  U-law compression is a very simple, fast but low quality way to reduce the size of the audio by about 50%. This format was one of the first audio
formats supported by
Web browsers, and it is still often used for short sound effects where
quality is not as important.<br/>
Audacity exports both 8-bit u-law files, and 16-bit uncompressed files, which
are the same quality as wav or aiff files.
</p>

<h3>MP3 (MPEG I, Layer 3)</h3>

<p>This is a compressed audio format that is a very popular way to
store music.  It can compress audio by a factor of 10:1 with very
little degradation in quality.  Audacity can both import and export
this format.  For more information on how to export MP3 files from
within Audacity, see <a href="#exportmp3">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.
</p>

<h3>Ogg Vorbis</h3>

<p>This compressed audio format was designed to be a free
alternative to MP3.  Ogg Vorbis files are not as common, but
they are about the same size as MP3 with better quality to rival
AAC or WMA.  Audacity can import and export this format.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="envelope">Envelope Editing</a></h2>
<p>Audacity lets you edit the amplitude envelope of a track directly
using the Envelope Tool:</p>
<table style="border: 0">
<tr>
	<td><img src="images/tool_envelope.png" alt="Envelope Tool"/></td>
<td>Envelope tool
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Editing the amplitude envelope lets you change the volume of a track
gradually over time by adding a number of <b>control points</b> to
the track.  Each control point sets the amplitude (volume) at that
point in time, which can be as low as zero, and as high as 150% of the
normal maximum volume, and the volume is interpolated smoothly
between the points.
<br/>
The image below shows a track with an amplitude envelope, with the
Envelope Tool selected:
<img src="images/envelope_editing.png" alt="Track With Volume Envelope"/>
</p>

<p>
In the figure above, there are five control points, at 1.0, 3.0,
5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 seconds.
Each control point has up to four "handles" arranged vertically.
The top and bottom handles are positioned at the target volume, and the
middle handles are positioned a quarter-screen down, giving you a way
to move the envelope above the 1.0 level.
<br/>
Note the dotted line at the top and bottom between 5.0 and 8.0 seconds.
This indicates that the actual envelope is above the screen.  You can
see the entire contour by zooming vertically - position the cursor over
the vertical ruler to the left of the track and shift-click to zoom out.
<br/>
To create a new control point, just click.  To move a point, just drag.
To remove a point, click on it and drag it outside of the track, then
let go.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a id="exportmp3">MP3 Exporting</a></h2>
<p>Audacity cannot encode MP3 files by itself, because
the MP3 encoding algorithm is patented and cannot legally
be used in free programs.  However, Audacity has been
programmed to recognize other existing MP3 encoders that you
can download separately.  All you have to do is obtain the
appropriate MP3 encoder for your computer and then show
Audacity where it is located.</p>

<table style="border: 0; cellpadding: 4; text-align: left">
<tr>
	<th style="align: left">If you use...</th>
  <th style="align: left">You need to...</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Windows</td>
  <td>Download <b>LAME</b> and
    look for the file called <b>lame_enc.dll</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Linux/Unix</td>
  <td>Download <b>LAME</b> and compile it as a shared object,
    then look for the file called <b>libmp3lame.so</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Macintosh</td>
  <td>Download <b>LAMELib</b> (see our website for more info).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For links to these MP3 encoders, go to the Audacity web page
(http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and go to the page for
your operating system.<br/>

The first time you try to export an MP3 file, Audacity
will ask you to locate your MP3 encoder.  Locate the file
indicated above.  From then on, Audacity will not
need to ask you again and you will be able to export MP3
files easily.</p>

</p>
<pre>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</p>
<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</p>
<p>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</p>
<p>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</p>
<p>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</p>
<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p>


<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

<p><strong>0.</strong>
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>
<p>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</p>
<p>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong>
     You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     </li>
<li><strong>b)</strong>
     You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong>
     If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</p>
<p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>


<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong>
     Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
	</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong>
     Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,
     </li>
<li><strong>c)</strong>
     Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</p>

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong>
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</p>

<p>
<strong>6.</strong>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.</strong>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
</p>
<p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p>
<p>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

<p>
<strong>8.</strong>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>

<p>
<strong>9.</strong>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>10.</strong>
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</p>


<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>11.</strong>
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<p>
<strong>12.</strong>
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
