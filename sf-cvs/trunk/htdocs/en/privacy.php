<p><b>Audacity Announcement List Policy</b></p>

<p>(This is the list that you join by entering your email address in the
box on the left of this website.)</p>

<p> If you are interested in receiving announcements whenever new
versions of Audacity are released, you are welcome to enter your email
address in the box on the left and click "Add".  You will be added to
our private mailing list, which we will only use to send brief,
infrequent announcements.
</p>

<!-- Translators - please add a sentence which explains that these
 announcements will usually be in English only.  Possibly people can
 join users lists in their native languages later on, to hear
 announcements there.
-->

<p>
We value your privacy.
</p>

<p> At no time will the Audacity developers and/or maintainers of the
mailing list ever share the list with any third parties, for any
reason.  We will not store any other information about the users on
the list (not even your name!) and we will never post the mailing list
in a publicly accessible location.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please enter
your email address in the box to the left and press the "Remove" button.
This should remove you from our list immediately; no confirmation is
required and there will be no delay.  If for some reason it does not
work, please send email to <a href="mailto:dominic@audacityteam.org">dominic@audacityteam.org</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Audacity Mailing List Policy</b></p>

<p>(This applies to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-help">audacity-help</a>,
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-users">audacity-users</a>,
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-devel">audacity-devel</a>, and
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-translation">audacity-translation</a> mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
These lists are <i>discussion lists</i>.  When you post a message to any of these lists,
including <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-help">audacity-help</a>,
it will be sent to hundreds of people, including both Audacity developers and other members
of the general public.  Various websites, including Sourceforge, may publish archives of these
lists online.  Archives will not normally contain your email address.  However, there is nothing
to stop anyone in the public from subscribing to these mailing lists and publishing their own
archives, including email addresses.  If you are concerned about privacy you should use a
throwaway or temporary email address.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about this policy and are not comfortable posting your concerns
to the mailing lists, send a private email to the lead Audacity developer at:
<a href="mailto:dominic@audacityteam.org">dominic@audacityteam.org</a>.
