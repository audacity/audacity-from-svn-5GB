This is not an absolute list, but rather a sketchpad for keeping ideas,
refining them, critiquing them, and perhaps implementing them. But it's
better to write an idea down and throw it away than to have a good idea
and never remember it again.

META::
- decide which of these are planned for 1.0!
- library reorganization

UI::
- make colors configurable
- better ruler, both for time (horizontally) and magnitude/pitch (vertical)
- right-click capabilities
- ability to drag tracks instead of move down, move down, move down
- allow labels to contain selections, which would be activated by clicking
  on the label
- "Fit in window" also works vertically
- auto-fit on open (configurable?)
- add "trim" (= opposite of delete -- delete all but selection)
- invert selection
- legend for pitch and spectrum
- loop over a small segment
- better adaptation to different font sizes (sizers)

NEW FEATURES::
- visualization window: VU meters, equalizer, continuous waveform, oscilloscope
- EQ

LOW LEVEL ISSUES::
- support more bit rates, allow conversion
- more robust up/downsampling
- import/export ogg vorbis everywhere
- move to portaudio (www.portaudio.com), when it's ready
- move to lossless compression (FLAC?) for internal representation
