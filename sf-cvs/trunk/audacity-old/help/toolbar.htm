<a name="selection"></a>
<p><img src="select.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Selection Tool
</b></font> 

<p>This is the main tool you use to select audio.  Click in a track to
position the cursor, or click and drag to select a range of audio.  If
you drag from one track to another, you can select multiple tracks.
Extend a selection by shift-clicking a new point in the track.
<p>
Playback will always begin at the position of the selection cursor.
If a range of audio is selected, only the selected range will play.

<a name="envelope"></a>
<p><img src="amp.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Envelope Tool
</b></font>

<p>The envelope tool gives you detailed control over how tracks fade
in and out, right in the main track window.  When the envelope tool
is selected, the amplitude envelope of each track is highlighted in
a green line, with control points at the beginning and end of each
track.  To change a control point, click it and drag it to a new
position.  To add a new point, click anywhere in the track where there
is not already a control point.  To remove a point, click on it and
drag it outside of the track until it disappears, then release.

<a name="timeshift"></a>
<p><img src="move.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Time Shift Tool
</b></font>

<p>This tool allows you to change the relative positioning of tracks
relative to one another in time.  To use this tool, simply click in a
track and drag it to the left or right.  To align two tracks together
or reset their time shift back to zero, use the
<a href="menu4.htm#aligntogether">Align Tracks Together</a> or
<a href="menu4.htm#alignzero">Align with Zero</a> 
commands.

<a name="zoom"></a>
<p><img src="zoom.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Zoom Tool
</b></font>

<p>This tool allows you to zoom in or out of a specific part of the audio.
To zoom in, click anywhere in the audio.  To zoom out, right-click or
shift-click.  If you have a middle button, you can middle-click to
do the same thing as 
<a href="menu3.htm#zoomnormal">Zoom Normal</a>.

<a name="play"></a>
<p><img src="play.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Play Button
</b></font>

<p>Press the play button to listen to the audio in your project.  You can
also hit the spacebar to start or stop playback.  Playback begins
at the current cursor position.  If a region of audio is selected, only
the selected region will play.  To quickly play the entire project,
execute 
<a href="menu2.htm#selectall">Select All</a> before playing.
If there are multiple tracks going to the same channel in your
project, they will be mixed automatically for playback.

<a name="stop"></a>
<p><img src="stop.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Stop Button
</b></font>

<p>Press the stop button or hit the spacebar to stop playback immediately.

<a name="record"></a>
<p><img src="record.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Record Button
</b></font>

<p>Press the record button to record a new track from your computer's
sound input device.  Use the 
<a href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a> to configure the recording options.
In particular, there is an option to record stereo or mono, and there is
an option to play the other tracks while recording, which doesn't work
on all systems.
<p>
Recording always happens at the project's sample rate.

<a name="gain"></a>
<p><img src="volume.png" align=middle><font size=+0><b>
Master Gain Control
</b></font>

<p>The Master Gain Control is a slider which controls the volume of the
audio output by Audacity to your hardware.  Pushing the slider all the
way to the left will mute Audacity, and pushing it to the right will
increase the volume of everything beyond its normal level and may cause
clipping.
