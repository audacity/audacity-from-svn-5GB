Mtodo.txt

This is the file where we keep track of all feature
requests and plans, and organize them by which
release they're going in.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Website / Sourceforge
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Upload some icons for people to use with
  KDE, GNOME, WindowMaker, AfterStep, BlackBox...
- Add a web counter
- Make a log of HTTP_REFERER so we see where people
  are coming from

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.0.1 TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Address all bugs in "bugs.txt"
- Make Audacity compile on Unix even if dlopen is
  not supported (work around wxGTK 2.2.9 bug where
  it can't be found)
- Experiment with much larger recording buffers - does
  latency suffer?  Do we care?  Does it result in fewer
  underflows?
- Test the "instant stop" on Windows and Mac.  Should
  it be used for recording, too?
- Bug on Linux: hold down spacebar to keep playing/stopping,
  gets in endless loop...
- Support MP3 exporting at even lower bitrates
- Select region by typing in start and stop times

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.1 In Progress / Partially complete
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Make all keyboard shortcuts configurable
- Command-line exporting
- LADSPA support (needs work - see email from
  Jim Hainis about Pluggo)

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.1 TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------

Mac OS X:
- Preferences menu item in right place
- Cmd-Q for Quit
- Use system-wide VST directory

Coding standards::
- Replace most assertions with error-checking code

Stability::
- Handle disk errors more cleanly.  Back out of whatever
  operation is going on.
- Do "preflight" check of disk space before editing
  operations.
- Check for existence of project _folder_ when opening
  a project - help the user find it if it's not there.

Unit tests::
- Need to verify that the new 1.0 mixing code plays every
  sample one and only once.

Audio::
- Smart Record dialog
  - VU meter
  - Control latency
  - Use as little CPU power as possible
  - Detect dropped samples using many different methods
  - Visually show buffer sizes
  - Multi-channel record
  - Show remaining disk space
  - Timed record (i.e. only record x seconds)
- Choice of dither
- Pre-roll and post-roll: amount to play before and after
  a selection (see DG Malham email)
- Latency control in Audio I/O prefs
- portmixer
  - output volume
  - input device
  - input volume
  - playthrough
- Support portaudio multiple driver models
- Play to End button (from selection, to end)

Internationalization:
- Fix strings which aren't being translated
- Pop-up language choice dialog when program starts
- Use pop-up menu in Prefs dialog
- Work around wxWindows bug which only searches
  working directory for language directories

UI::
- Select None
- Small toolbar option
- Create our own progress dialog:
  - Improved time estimate
  - Stop and cancel buttons (not the same!)
- Save preferences (write to disk) after closing dialog
- A "mini view" of the whole project, which shows what part
  you're working on, etc. like a lot of other programs have
- Visual track dragging
- Split at labels
- Improve Save dialogs: use "Save", "Don't Save", and
  include the name of the file.
- When a user exports the entire project (in any format)
  and the export doesn't require any mixing, mark the project
  as not dirty (i.e. don't ask if they want to save it).
- Put close box in toolbar.
- Make toolbar minimize when you minimize all Audacity windows
  (on MS Windows only)
- Sample format prefs should actually work (should
  affect recording - maybe provide an option to decide
  what to do with imported recordings...)
- Make ID3 tag dialog optional when saving MP3s
- Horizonal line at zero point in waveform display
- Vertical playback position indicator
- Option to turn off blinking cursor
- Change text of Undo menu item (Undo Cut, Undo Amplify, etc.)
- While playing, click in ruler to change playback
  position
- Remember window size and position
- Import... should be able to import Audacity projects
  and Audacity project files
- Crash recovery
- Clean up a project directory upon open
- Out of disk space checks
- Nudge selection with arrow keys
- Make colors configurable
- Adapt text color - should be white by default if
  the background color is very dark
- Select dialog box ("1.5 - 3.0 seconds")
  and allow selection by frames (24 frames/sec), samples, etc.
- Invert selection (for now, until we allow discontiguous selections,
                    this should mean two options: select up to selection,
                    and select after selection)
- Zero Crossings (nudge selection to nearest ZC's)
- Finish history window
- Vertical zooming
- Pan control for each track
- Volume control for each track
- Vertical bar indicating playback/recording position, too
- Add high-quality resampling
- Legend (Ruler) for pitch and spectrum
- Recognize .mp2, .mpg, .mpeg as libmad-capable files
- 1/24, 1/25 and 1/30-second frame count options for ruler.
- Envelope editor should support linear, quadratic, and exponential,
  ideally with a right-click.  Default should be linear; it makes the
  most sense visually.  Also add to Filter dialog?
- Some way to insert silence with the mouse???
- Looping - two forms of looping:
  * An option to continuously loop the selection during playback
    (maybe a "loop" checkbox under the Play button)
  * A way to turn a track into a loop.  It would be cool if the
    display showed the "real" waveform once, and then "ghosts" of
    that waveform repeating forever...
- Drag the play marker in the ruler to "skip" to a new time
   
Import/Export::
- Use latest libsndfile; finish exporting code
- Rewrite the Import Raw Data... code
- Import Audacity 1.0 projects
- Support ID3 tags in Ogg files
- Import/Export markers in WAV files (like Goldwave does - 
  see email from Shane M.)
- Import directly from audio CD?

Effects::
- Fix VST plugin problems;
  - UltraFunk Surround (see email from iceberg@techropolis.com)
- Fix the 47-second bug in Noise Removal (see email
  from Greg Trounson)
- Show spectrum in FFT filter
- Effects dialogs
  - Preview button
  - Save presets
  - How to do this? Either have all effects dialogs inherit from
    one, or have a sub-window for preview and presets.
- Add real-time effects directly to tracks (see Ezequiel 5/10/2002)
- Freeverb 3.0 (and better interface)
- Pitch/tempo change
- Smart Mix (like Quick Mix but guarantees no clipping)
- Cross-fade (smooth between two tracks)
- Compressor/Limiter/Expander
- Native port of Freeverb (ideally optimized)
- EQ
- Auto find track boundaries
- Pop/click removal
- Save VST plug-in parameters to a file, or at least
  remember the last settings

-----------------------------------------------------------
Future:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Speed issues when you have a project of 5 or more tracks
- Edit markers
- Ability to drag tracks instead of move down, move down, move down
- "Fit in window" also works vertically
- Better adaptation to different font sizes (sizers)
- Move to lossless compression (FLAC?) for internal representation
- discontiguous selection
- visualization window: VU meters, equalizer, continuous waveform, oscilloscope
- Scrubbing
- Mouse scroller should vertically scroll project
- Delete key should be permanently mapped on to the delete operation
- User-adjustable fonts so I don't have to recompile just to get the
  ruler looking decent and the track label fitting.
- Export menu options changed to generic "Export as..." and   "Export selection as..." leading to a format selection dialog.
  (ogg/mp3/flac/wav/etc.)
- A way to use the envelope tool to amplify (I have no clue
  how this would work).
- a way to manually manipulate individual samples (e.g., a new tool mode
  or a keyboard modifier that allows you to grab a sample and drag it to
  the spot you really want it at)

Low level issues::
- support multi-track I/O
- support an arbitrary number of channels
- Make projects one big file

-----------------------------------------------------------
Completed:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Make "Exit program upon closing last window" an option
  in the Preferences.  (This wasn't implemented like this,
  but instead the program doesn't quit when the last window
  is closed on the Mac, but it does on other platforms.
  This mimics correct native behavior.)
- Get announcement list running
- Note on website that Audacity is incompatible
  with Norton Protected Recycle Bin (see email
  from Josef Ravenscroft)
- Plug-ins should be split into many separate menus on Linux/GTK
  (if you have lots of them)
