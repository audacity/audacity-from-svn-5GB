================================================================

Before trying to compile Audacity, please make sure that
your copy of Visual C++ 6.0 has been upgraded to Service
Patch 5.  If you require it, this patch is available from
Microsoft at

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/default.asp

It is worth noting that Audacity uses VC++'s multithreaded
statically-linked run-time libraries.

---------------------------
STEP 1:  Download wxWindows
---------------------------
To simplify the implementation of a near-identical user
interface across platforms, Audacity uses classes and
resources from wxWindows, a portable GUI framework for C++
(and Python).  You must download and build wxWindows before
attempting to compile Audacity, or nothing will work!

wxWindows is available from http://www.wxwindows.org.
Similar to the Linux kernel, wxWindows is available as
stable and development branches.  

Audacity 1.1.1 uses wxWindows 2.3.3, the unstable development 
branch, available at

  http://www.wxwindows.org/dl_msw2.htm#dev


------------------------
STEP 2:  Build wxWindows
------------------------
When you have downloaded and installed wxWindows, you must
build it.  First though, to be compatible with Audacity, you
must alter the build settings to use the multithreaded
statically-linked run-time libraries instead of the
multithreaded DLL run-time libraries.  This isn't hard:

1. Launch Visual C++ and open the workspace file called
   "wxWindows.dsw" in the "src" directory of your wxWindows
   installation.

2. Select "Project"->"Settings" (Alt+F7), choose "Win32 Release"
   in the "Settings For" combo box and select everything visible
   in the tree window on the left of the dialog box.

3. Now select the "C/C++" tab and change "Use run-time library"
   under the 'Code Generation' combo box to "Multithreaded".

4. Now select "Win32 Debug" from the "Settings For" combo and
   change the run-time library to "Debug Multithreaded".

5. Now you can click "OK" and build wxWindows by selecting
   "Build"->"Batch Build" and clicking "Rebuild All".

This will build both Debug and Release versions of the
wxWindows library.

--------------------------
STEP 3:  Download Audacity
--------------------------
Now you can compile Audacity.  If you want to checkout a
copy of the latest source code from CVS (assuming you
haven't already!), there are instructions at
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/cvs.php. Run Visual C++ and
load the Audacity workspace: it's "audacity.dsw" in the
"win" directory of the Audacity source tree.

--------------------------------------------
STEP 4:  Set wxWindows location for Audacity
--------------------------------------------
Before you can start the build process, you must update the
project settings to tell Visual C++ where to find wxWindows.
There are three settings that need changing:
    1.  Include Directory (e.g., "C:\wxWindows_2.3.3\include")
    2.  Resource Directory (e.g., "C:\wxWindows_2.3.3\include")
    3.  Library Directory (e.g., "C:\wxWindows_2.3.3\lib")

Fortunately, this is parameterized, using a Windows system 
environment variable. There are various ways to set these, so 
look in the Windows help system. You want to creat an 
environment variable WXWIN, set to the top-level directory 
where you installed wxWindows. For example, 
in your Autoexec.bat file, you might have a line:

   set WXWIN="C:\wxWindows_2.3.3"

Note that you don't want a trailing backslash on that. In the 
Audacity project file, there are declarations like 

   $(WXWIN)\include

that get interpreted as, e.g., "C:\wxWindows_2.3.3\include".

Once you have set the WXWIN environment variable correctly, 
the Audacity project file's declarations will do the rest.

---------------------------
STEP 5:  Ignore lib setting
---------------------------
Some people previously reported error messages linking
Audacity.  You may not have this problem.  However, if you
receive error messages during the link process, try the
following.

Go to the "Project"->"Settings" menu item in Visual Studio.

Ignore lib. Select "Win32 Debug" or "Win32 Release" as
appropriate for the build you were doing from the "Settings For"
combo. Select only "Audacity" in the tree, the Link tab, and
"Input" in the combo box. Enter "libcmtd.lib" in the
"Ignore Libraries" box if you were attempting to perform a
Release build, or "libcmt.lib" for a Debug build.

-----------------------
STEP 6:  Build Audacity
-----------------------
To build libsndfile on Windows, you'll need to copy both 
"sndfile.h" and "config.h" from "libsndfile/Win32/" to 
"libsndfile/src/" before you compile. 

Now select the configuration that you wish to build
("Audacity - Win32 Release" for general use, "Audacity -
Win32 Debug" for a slower but debuggable executable) from
the "Build"->"Set Active Configuration" dialog and choose
"Build"->"Rebuild All" to compile Audacity!

That's all - if this procedure doesn't work, you can ask for
help on the Audacity development mailing list:
audacity-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  The first suggestion
is likely to be "try it again with a clean installation of
the wxWindows source and the latest Audacity source from
CVS" though, so if that's not what you just attempted, you
might want to try that first...
