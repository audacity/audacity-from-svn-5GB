bugs.txt

This file is where we keep track of all known bugs
in Audacity. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs to fix:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Hitting the spacebar causes Audacity to start playing
  (Mac OS only?)
- Double-clicking a track selects all in the ruler, but
  not the track (Windows)
- Right-click doesn't always zoom out, esp. after
  doing a drag-zoom...
- Segfault if slide tool is used while playing/recording
- Exporting using LAME does incorrect sample rate,
  or incorrect # of channels?  Maybe only with certain
  versions of LAME?
- Core dump when doing long recordings on Linux
- ID3 genre list doesn't fit in the window on Linux/GTK
- Fix underflow problems when recording (as much as
  possible) and try to report them if not
- Use latest FreeVerb (3.0)
- Fix divide-by-zero bug in Envelope.cpp (can crash
  on Windows)
- (possibly Mac only?) Copy portion of file, paste into
  new project, save and close new project, CRASH!
  See email from TC Baker
- Link against libwx_gtk.so in RPM, and add instructions
  to ln -s /usr/lib/libwx_gtk-2.2.so /usr/lib/libwx_gtk.so
- 'amplify' effect can change -1 amplitude to +1
-  when the top track of a stereo track is shrunk so that
  the 'solo' and 'mute' fields appear beside the lower track, these   buttons no longer work
- layout of Edit toolbar buttons sucks in Windows(tm) (my fault)
- drag-floating toolbars produces wierd ghosting of other previous
  images in Windows(tm).
- Skip-to-beginning/skip-to-end go to the absolute beginning or the
  absolute end of all tracks, rather than the beginning/end of the
  current track.
- The ruler selection coloring responds strangely when you click or
  double-click on the ruler.
- Clicking on the track label selects the entire track, but is also used
  for dragging the track vertically.  These can be conflicting
  operations. Maybe the label needs a dragging 'affordance' on the left
  edge or top (little graphical bumps or something) that can be used to
  grab drag the track, with the rest of the label offering the 'select
  all' behavior. This would make the ability to drag tracks around more
  obvious as well.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Possible bugs to investigate:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Exporting tracks with envelopes and an offset can result
  in different WAV output than what you see on the screen in
  the editor.  (See email from Mike Tyson).
- Linux: hit Undo lots of times in a row crashes.
  (Email from Daniel James)  Can't reproduce.
- Audacity is unstable when working with very large files
- Possible memory leak in Windows 98 (???)
  See emails from degarb@softhome.net
- Problem reading AIFF files on Mac OS X?
  (Private email from Tobias Jeger - the attached
	AIFF file worked fine under Linux)
- Does "make install" create all of the directories
  it wants to installs into
- Test USB mics under Mac OS 9 (see email from J. Blucher)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Fixed, need to port:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Single instance checker (added to MSW only of 0.9
  branch, need to port to HEAD)
- Change menu item when you change export format
  (need to port to HEAD)
- Find VST folder on startup (need to port to HEAD)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Fixed:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Audacity won't start under (some versions of?) MacOS 8.5,
  complains about InterfaceLib and SetAntiAliasedTextEnabled
  (now OS 8.6 is required)
- Typing in the root directory as the Temp Files path
  doesn't work (on Mac OS X)? (can't reproduce)
- Menu bar does not function when Prefs dialog is
  in front on MacOS
- Get rid of any "exit()" calls in snd/ or other
  libraries
- Problems recording at other than 44100 Hz on Mac
- Recording at a rate other than 44100 works, but the
  track created has the wrong rate in its label
- Fix id3lib compilation problems on Linux
  (worked around: it's disabled by default)
- Freeze when opening Prefs panel on MacOS 8.6
  (fixed in wxWindows: it was an incompatibility with ATM)
- Copy and Paste between projects
- Temp directory in Prefs dialog should have a "Chooose..."
  button to let you select a directory with a standard
  file dialog.
- RPM dependency is wrong - it should depend on:
  libwx_gtk-2.2.so.6, not libwx_gtk.so
  # Necessary for building the package: rpm -ba
    BuildRequires:	wxGTK >= [version number if required]i 
  # Necessary for installing the package: rpm -ivh
    Requires:	wxGTK >= [version number if required]
- Clicking close box only deletes one track of
  stereo pair
- Audacity "forgets" tracks' channels when saving/loading
- Needs to handle temp directory better - bring up a
  dialog if it's not there...
- Undoing an envelope edit sometimes causes problems
- Recording/Playback devices backwards on Windows
- Need to have a warning when you write over a file the
  project depends on - and an option to rename the file
  if necessary.
- Set Rate... dialog doesn't initialize with the
  current rate.  Sometimes 0, sometimes junk.
  (Note that there are two of these dialogs.)
- Better aRts support (or at least a warning???)
- Zoom tool shouldn't change selection
- Scrolling with the zoom tool shouldn't zoom.
- Closing a project window should throw away all blockfiles
  other than the ones in the last saved version.  (Implement
  this in conjunction with save changes dialogs.)
- Save As... for a project should work.
- Bug fixed: each track's channel was not being saved
  in the project file.
  (Was: stereo "linked" track that's really two mono tracks,
   Check upon opening project)
- Bug fixed: Must warn user if temp directory can't be created
  Now checks on startup and opens Prefs Dialog for user to fix.
- Bug fixed: Duplicate track doesn't work if track is shifted
  past zero.  Track selection and copying are now more aware
  of offsets.
- Filenames with a period outside the extension are truncated.
- "New..." menu item should be "New"
- Crash in NoiseRemoval effect on Windows.
- Shouldn't create envelope points outside the track range.
- Compiled id3lib for Windows version.
- Changed pthread_yield to sched_yield for portability.
- Crash closing track or project while recording.
