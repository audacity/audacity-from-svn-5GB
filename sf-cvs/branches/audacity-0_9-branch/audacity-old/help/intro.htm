<font size=+0><b>What can you do with <font color="#000099">Audacity</font>?</b></font>



<p><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a program that manipulates digital audio

waveforms. In addition to recording sounds directly from

within the program, it imports many sound file formats, including

<a href="fileformats.htm#wav">WAV</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#aiff">AIFF</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#au">AU</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#ircam">IRCAM</a>,

<a href="fileformats.htm#mp3">MP3</a>, and

<a href="fileformats.htm#ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a>.  

It supports all common editing

operations such as Cut, Copy, and Paste, plus it will mix tracks and

apply plug-in effects to any part of a sound. It also has a

built-in amplitude envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode

and a frequency analysis window for audio analysis applications.



<p><font size=+0><b>What can't <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> do?</b></font>



<p>Although <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a very powerful

audio editor that works with an unlimited number tracks of virtually

unlimited size, it cannot do everything:



<ul>

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>

cannot record more than two channels at once.  It does

not support any special hardware, but just works with the system's

default audio device.

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> opens MIDI files,

but it is not a MIDI editor, and its

    MIDI features are extremely limited.

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> cannot resample

audio to different sample rates (yet).

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> currently only

works with 16-bit quality audio (so far - 

    support for higher quality audio is planned).

</ul>
