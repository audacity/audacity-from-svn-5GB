	A <a href="effects_reverb.html">Reverb</a> usualy gives you the choice of how
	much effects signal(also called WET part) and how much of the original signal(also called
	DRY part) you'd like to the plugin to output.
</p>
<p class=a>
	A processor doesn't have this option by nature. The
	Equalizer and the <a href="effects_compressor.html">Compressor</a>
	are processors. To mix the original signal and the processed signal doesn't make sense for these
	processors. Their output is always 100% WET.

<td valign=top width="50%">

<p class=a>
	Not only do they output 100% WET signal, but nobody usualy mixes the unprocessed signals with the processed
	either. They do so with <a href="effects_reverb.html">Reverb</a> and <a href="effects_delay.html">Delay</a>
	signals.
</p>
<p class=a>
	Processors are usualy placed in an <B>INSERT</B>, which means they sit in the channel.
	The EQs on your stereo or soundcard mixer work like this. The signal passes through them.
