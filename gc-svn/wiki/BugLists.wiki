= Introduction =

Here are some 'canned' issue tracker queries:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/audacity/issues/list The default issue tracker report].
  * [http://code.google.com/p/audacity/issues/list?can=2&q=&sort=-opsys+component&colspec=ID%20Opsys%20Priority%20Type%20Component%20Summary Issues by Platform] - Windows / Vista / Mac / Linux
  * [http://code.google.com/p/audacity/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3ARegression Regressions] - Features that worked in an earlier version and are currently broken.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/audacity/issues/list?can=2&q=label%3AMoonPhaseBug+OR+label%3AHeisenBug&colspec=ID+Summary+Priority+Status+Type&cells=tiles HeisenBugs] - This includes bugs that are hard to reproduce (moon phase bugs) with the genuine Heisnbugs (bugs which change when you try to track them down).

= Issue Tracker Status =

Using Google's issue tracker is just an experiment at the moment.  The live tracker is our  [http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Release_Checklist Release Checklist wiki page].  The real tracker has many more P3's and higher, and has links to e-mail threads.
