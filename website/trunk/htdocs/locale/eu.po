msgid "<p>Beginning with version 1.1.1, Audacity allows you to use the Nyquist programming language to write your own plug-in effects for Audacity.  Unlike VST and LADSPA plug-ins, Nyquist plug-ins can be written using an ordinary text editor and don't need to be compiled.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist was written by <a href=\"http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/\">Roger B. Dannenberg</a> and was intended to be used as a complete programming language for audio synthesis and analysis, with support for MIDI, audio recording and playback, file I/O, object-oriented programming, profiling, debugging and more.  Audacity uses only a subset of Nyquist's functionality, allowing you to take simple Nyquist functions and use them to process audio data.   Audacity doesn't include any support for debugging Nyquist code, so if you are trying to write a complicated plug-in, you may find it easier to get the full version of Nyquist and develop there, then turn it into an Audacity plug-in.  Nyquist is available from the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Music Project:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><a href=\"http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~music/music.software.html\">CMU Computer Music Project Software</a> - download the full Nyquist here</a></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To write plug-ins for use with Audacity, you will need the older <a href=\"http://www.audacity-forum.de/download/edgar/nyquist/nyquist-doc/manual/home.html\">Nyquist version 2.37 Manual</a>, not the version 3 manual available from CMU. This is because in Nyquist version 3 the code notation has changed to SAL instead of LISP. We will investigate integrating SAL with the Audacity implementation of Nyquist in the future.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Note that you don't need to download Nyquist in order to write simple plug-ins to use with Audacity.  All of the instructions you need are below.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Lisp</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist is based on Lisp.  If you have programmed in Lisp before, you can skim this section or go directly to the <a href=\"nyquist2\">next page</a>.  Otherwise, here's an extremely brief introduction to Lisp:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Lisp (and therefore Nyquist), everything is an S-Expression, which is just a list of tokens (words) separated by whitespace and enclosed in parentheses.  The name of the function is always the first token in an S-Expression, and all of the other tokens are arguments to this function.  Here's a simple example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf area (* 3.14159 (expt radius 2)))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let's break down this example.  The outermost S-expression has three members.  The first one, <code>setf</code>, is the name of the function (it stands for set-field).  <code>setf</code> is used to assign a value to a variable.  (There are other similar functions, like <code>set</code> and <code>setq</code>, but <code>setf</code> is the most powerful, so it's the one we'll use in our examples.) After <code>setf</code> comes <code>area</code>, which is the name of the variable we're going to set.  Next comes the value to assign to this variable, which in this case is another S-expression.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lisp doesn't have any special operators for Math functions - they're all functions like everything else, using <i>prefix</i> notation, where the name of the function (or operator) come before its arguments.  So instead of 3*7 for the product of 3 and 7, in Lisp you would write (* 3 7).  In Nyquist, the <code>expt</code> (exponent) function raises its first argument to the power of the second argument.  Therefore <code>(* 3.14159 (expt radius 2))</code> means 3.14159 times the square of <code>radius</code>, or the formula for the area of a circle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rather than typing in this full expression every time, let's define a function for the area of the circle, that we can call every time we need it:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (defun circlearea (radius) (* 3.14159 (expt radius 2)))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <code>defun</code> function is used to define a new function.  The first argument is the name of the function, in this case <code>circlearea</code>.  The second argument is a list of arguments to the function to be defined - this is one of the few cases where you have an S-expression that is not interpreted as a function call.  Finally the last expression is the value of the function.  Now if we want to compute the area of a circle of radius <code>r</code>, we just need to compute:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf area (circlearea r))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An S-expression is just a representation of a list.  Lisp uses lists to represent just about everything (the name LISP comes from LISt Processing language), so it's helpful to know how to manipulate lists.  Let's start by assigning a list of numbers to a variable.  You can't quite do this:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf mylist (1 2 3 4 5))  <font color=#cc0000><--  error!</font>\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The reason this doesn't work is that whenever Nyquist sees an S-expression, it tries to evaluate it as a function unless you tell it otherwise.  Since there's no function named \"1\" that takes arguments <code>(2 3 4 5)</code>, this will generate an error.  To tell lisp that you want to treat an S-expression literally, and not to evaluate it as a function, you <i>quote</i> it.  In Nyquist, you can quote a list by putting a single quotation mark before it, like this:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf mylist '(1 2 3 4 5))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist also provides a <code>list</code> function that you can use to construct lists - this is useful if some of the elements of the list are functions:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (setf mylist (list 1 2 3 4 (sqrt 25)))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To get things off of a list, you can use the <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code> functions.  (Traditionally, these were called <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, respectively, but <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code> are much easier to remember.  Both sets of names are supported in Nyquist.)  The output of <code>(first mylist)</code> is 1, and the output of <code>(rest mylist)</code> is the list <code>(2 3 4 5)</code>.  So the second element of the list is <code>(first (rest mylist))</code>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Lisp function reference</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here's a list of some of the basic lisp functions you might need.  For a complete list of Lisp / Nyquist functions, see the <a href=\"http://www.audacity-forum.de/download/edgar/nyquist/nyquist-doc/manual/home.html\">Nyquist version 2.37 Reference Manual</a>.</p>\n"

"<b>Envelopes</b>\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist has support for envelopes.  By applying an envelope to a sound, you can control the overall shape of its amplitude.  One of the easiest ways to construct an envelope is with the <code>env</code> function, which takes 7 parameters that are commonly used for shaping synthesized musical notes: attack time, decay time, release time, attack level, decay level, sustain level, and overall duration.  See the figure below:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img alt=\"Nyquist envelope diagram.\" src=\"../images/nyquist-envelope\" width=\"467\" height=\"200\"></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To apply an envelope to a sound, just use the <code>mult</code> function.  So if <code>s</code> is a sound, then this is the sound with a simple envelope applied to it:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  (mult s (env 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.0 0.5 0.3 1.0))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One of the most general type of envelope is a piece-wise linear function, which can be constructed with the <code>pwl</code> function.  The pwl function takes a list of parameters which denote (time, value) pairs. There is an implicit initial (time, value) pair of (0, 0), and an implicit final value of 0. There should always be an odd number of parameters, since the final time is not implicit.  For example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ; symmetric rise to 0.7 (at time 1) and fall back to 0 (at time 2):\n"
"  (pwl 1.0 0.7 2.0)\n"
"</pre>\n"

"<h3>Combining sounds</h3>\n"

"<h3><a href=\"nyquist3\">Next: Creating Nyquist Plug-Ins</a></h3>"
msgstr ""

#: help/nyquist3.php:22
msgid "<p>Creating a plug-in for Audacity using Nyquist is as simple as creating a text file with the extension \".ny\" with some Nyquist code, adding a few comments to indicate the type of plug-in, and placing the file in Audacity's <code>plug-ins</code> directory.  Here's a very simple plug-in as an example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ;nyquist plug-in\n"
"  ;version 1\n"
"  ;type process\n"
"  ;name \"Fade In\"\n"
"  ;action \"Fading In...\"\n"
"  (mult (ramp) s)\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first two lines of a Nyquist plug-in must be exactly as in the example above, or Audacity will not load it.  (The version number is to support future expansions of the plug-in format.) The next line is the type of plug-in, which is discussed below.  Then comes the name of the plug-in, which is what is displayed in the menu bar, and then the \"action\", which is what Audacity displays while it is busy processing the plug-in.  There are other optional lines that may follow.  Any line that does not begin with a semicolon (;) is assumed to contain Nyquist code and will be executed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Audacity has support for three types of plug-ins that can be written in Nyquist:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ;type generate\n"
"  ;type process\n"
"  ;type analyze\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These correspond to the three menus that can contain plug-ins: Generate, Effect, and Analyze.  Generate plug-ins are expected to generate new audio from scratch, Effect plug-ins (\"process\") modify existing audio in-place, and Analyze plug-ins process audio but do not modify it (though they are allowed to add labels).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For Effect and Analyze plug-ins, Audacity sets up the Nyquist environment so that the audio the user has selected is in the variable <code>s</code>.  All of the expressions in the plug-in file are executed in order, and the return value of the last expression is substituted for the selection in Audacity.  If the last expression does not return audio, Audacity returns an error.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Parameter dialogs</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Audacity has limited support for plug-ins showing a dialog to get parameters from the user.  Here is an example of a plug-in that opens a dialog:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ;nyquist plug-in\n"
"  ;version 1\n"
"  ;type process\n"
"  ;name \"Delay...\"\n"
"  ;action \"Performing Delay Effect...\"\n"
"  ;info \"Demo effect for Nyquist by Roger Dannenberg.\\n"
"This effect \n"
"     creates a fixed number of echos.\"  ; (should be all on one line)\n"
"  ;control decay \"Decay amount\" int \"dB\" 6 0 24\n"
"  ;control delay \"Delay time\" real \"seconds\" 0.5 0.0 5.0\n"
"  ;control count \"Number of echos\" int \"times\" 5 1 30\n"
"\n"
"  (defun delays (s decay delay count)\n"
"    (if (= count 0) (cue s)\n"
"\t   (sim (cue s)\n"
"        (loud decay (at delay (delays s decay delay (- count 1)))))))\n"
"  (stretch-abs 1 (delays s (- 0 decay) delay count))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If Audacity finds at least one \"control\" line, it will open a dialog to prompt the user for certain parameters to the plug-in.  Each parameter consists of a text box and a slider, and after the user has entered each one, the final value will be stored in a Nyquist variable with a name that you specify on the \"control\" line.  Here's what the dialog for the Delay effect shown above looks like in Audacity for Linux:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img alt=\"Nyquist plugin screenshot\" src=\"../images/nyquist-plugin-screenshot\" width=\"414\" height=\"221\"></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Note that the \"info\" line is displayed at the top of the dialog, and that the \"\\n"
"\" becomes a newline.  The parameters to the \"control\" line affect the appearance and limitations of the parameter.  Each \"control\" line must consist of exactly the following 8 elements, in order:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ol>\n"
"\t<li>The word \"control\"</li>\n"
"\t<li>The name of the control - this is the name of the Nyquist variable that will get set when the user manipulates the dialog.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The label to the left of the control</li>\n"
"\t<li>The type of value: either <code>int</code> (integer) or <code>real</code>.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The label to the right of the value (usually the units like \"Hz\" or \"dB\").</li>\n"
"\t<li>The default/initial value of the parameter</li>\n"
"\t<li>The minimum value of the parameter</li>\n"
"\t<li>The maximum value of the parameter</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Returning labels</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of returning audio, a Nyquist plug-in can instead return a list of labels.  A list of labels is simply a list of time/label pairs, for example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ((0.0 \"start\") (30.0 \"middle\") (60.0 \"end\"))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When a plug-in returns a list of exactly this form, Audacity will create a new label track and add the labels at those positions.  This style of plug-in is usually of type \"analyze\".</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>New!  Beginning with Audacity version 1.3.1, you can now optionally return both a start and an end time, like this:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"  ((0.0 25.0 \"start\") (30.0 45.0 \"middle\") (60.0 75.0 \"end\"))\n"
"</pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Note that labels are allowed to overlap in Audacity 1.3; the end time of one can be after the start time of the next.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Processing stereo tracks</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nyquist represents stereo tracks as an array of sounds (not a list).  Many Nyquist functions automatically work with these arrays, but not all, so sometimes you may find it necessary to split up a stereo array, or reassemble one.  Here are some useful functions:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"function-list\">\n"
"<tr><td><code>(arrayp s)</code></td><td>returns true if <code>s</code> is an array</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(aref s 0)</code></td><td>the first element in array <code>s</code> - the left channel</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(aref s 1)</code></td><td>the second element in array <code>s</code> - the right channel</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(setf s (make-array 2))</code></td><td>makes <code>s</code> into a new array of length 2</td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(setf (aref s 0) left)</code></td><td>makes <code>left</code> the first element of array <code>s</code></td></tr>\n"
"<tr><td><code>(setf (aref s 1) right)</code></td><td>makes <code>right</code> the second element of array <code>s</code></td></tr>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As a convenience, if the input to your Nyquist plug-in is stereo, but you only output a single (mono) sound, Audacity will automatically copy it to both the left and right channels.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Where to go from here</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Audacity comes with some sample plug-ins that you can examine or modify as a starting point.  The best way to learn Nyquist is to try it.  If you're having trouble debugging, consider downloading the standalone version of Nyquist (see the link in Part 1).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you're having trouble getting Nyquist to work at all, please <a href=\"../contact/\">contact us</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you are working on Nyquist plug-in effects and would like to share them with others, or if you would like to discuss general details of how to achieve certain effects in Nyquist, please join the <a href=\"../contact/lists#nyquist\">audacity-nyquist mailing list</a>.</p>\n"
