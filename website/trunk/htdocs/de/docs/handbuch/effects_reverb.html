<P class=qr>What is Reverb ?</P>
<P class=a>
 A Reverb simulates the component of sound that results from reflections from surrounding walls or objects.
 It is in effect a room simulator. Some peope think it's just a delay effect with some filters, but it's way
 more complex than that. Reverb effects (software plugins or external hardware units) provide
 an interface to their changable parameters that need some explaining. Let's look at a simple room first.
</P>
<P class=qr>Basic Simulation of a Room</P>
<P class=a>
 <B>Our model is a simple room</B> with four straight walls, a sound source and a listener. In <i>Figure 1</i>
 the arrows stand for the path of travelling sound.
</P>
<P class=a>
 The listener hears the DIRECT signal first. The DIRECT signal is also referred to as the DRY part of the signal when using
 any effect. Most digital reverbs produce two parts: The Early Reflections and the Reverb component.

<td valign=top>
 <P class=a>
  The first Early Reflection reaches the listener milliseconds after
  the direct signal does.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  The path of the Early Reflections is longer. The difference in time between the arrival of
  the direct signal and the first Early Reflections is measured in milliseconds.
 </P>

  The sound reflects off the walls and objects in the room, and in time individual reflections
  disapear and the Reverb develops.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  <U><B>Predelay</B></U><BR>
  The time between the reception of the DIRECT signal by the listener and start of the Reverb portion
  of the effect is called <B>Predelay</B>. This is a parameter in many digital reverb effects, and it
  is expressed in milliseconds (ms).
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  <U><B>Reverb Time</B></U><BR>
  The time difference between switching off any sound generator and the level of the reverb resulting
  from that sound dropping by 60dB is called <B>RT60</B>.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  This is usualy referred to as the <B>Reverb Time</B>. When anyone refers to the reverb time
  of a real room or that of a digital reverb, RT60 is what they're talking about.
 </P>
 <P class=a>
  Most digital reverbs feature this as a parameter.

   </P>
   <P class=a>
    The greater the enclosed(!) volume of the space you're in, the longer the reverb time. This is of course true only
    to a certain extent. The larger the room or chamber, the louder your source signal needs to be to produce any
    significant level of reverb tail. A good way to demonstrate this is to visit some huge cathedral and talk quietly.
    Then yell a bit and you'll actualy hear some significantly loud reverb. The RT60 value is measured with a noise impuls, but the level
    at which that impulse was sent out should be known too.
   </P>
   <P class=a>
    Many reverb effects let you set different reverb times for different frequency bands. Most reverb units on PC and Mac architectures provide two bands,
    so you get to set the reverb time for each frequency band individualy.

   <P class=a>
    These EQs are applied continously to an evolving reverb of a piece of audio.
    Over time, as the reverb fades, so do certain frequencies, either in the lower
    or higher frequency range. The more less-reflective surfaces the sound bounces
    around from, the more the reverb is dampened the higher frequencies.

   <P class=a>
    Freeverb features a Damping parameter that dampens the upper frequencies.

 Here we have the Hishelf and Lowshelf EQs for Damping(left) and for the final output(right). The upper middle display
 depicts the Early Reflections placement and level, as well as the Reverb portion start and fading. Above this display
 is the <i>Reverb Type</i> selector. This changes the placement and level of the Early Reflections. The <i>Size</i> slider
 has influence on the Early Reflections as well.
</P>

<!-- P class=a>
 The surface of a wall as well as different shapes and sizes of objects in a room influence
 the way sound reflects, bends or spreads from off them.
</P -->
<P class=a>
 Blank concrete will reflect sound quite well across the frequency spectrum. A large thick curtain
 or padded walls will reflect sound poorly. A large club filled with people sounds completly different
 from an empty one. People, comfy chairs, curtains, carpets, beds and many more objects reflect only
 part of the sound that hits them.
