# ============================
# Variables in this section configure the project, host etc to use at
# Google Code.
# $SFUSER must be set from outside to a valid SF user name, but it will be 
# different for everyone who uses this file, so no point setting it here.
#
# You need to use Google Code username / password to work SVN, but they don't 
# crop up in this file because it doesn't do network SVN operations
#
# project name on sourceforge

# Options to all rsync commands:
RSYNCOPTS=-vrchlO --delete-during --rsh=ssh --exclude '*~' --exclude '*.po'
# -v Verbose mode transfers
# -r Recursive transfer of whole dir tree
## -t transfer modification times of files
# -c Use file's md4 checksums to see if they need to be transfered (slower but
#    more reliable than using size and modtimes of files)
# -h Output data in human-readable formats
# -l Preserve links in the uploaded data
# -O Ommit directory modification times (because they are largely meaningless)
#--delete-during	delete deleted files as they are found (uses minimum disk
#					space but is safe against aborted transfers)
#--exclude '*~'		avoid moving editor temp files
#--exclude '*.po'	don't move .po files (source code of translations) to/from
#					server because it can't use them (it only wants the .mo
#					compiled versions)
