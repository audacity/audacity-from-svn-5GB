<p class=qr>Sound Editing in the &quot;real world&quot;</p>
<p class=a>Sound editors clean up dialogue tracks, cut layers of special
effects, place sounds at certain times, create ambiance tracks by cutting out
unwanted stuff and mixing in interesting or necessary sounds. Music production
engineers may cut pieces of vocals away or shift them to a another spot in a
song.</p>

<p class=a>Editing is about cutting, placing, fading, cross-fading, shifting,
duplicating and adjusting the volume (also referred to as level) of audio
material. Mixing is a form of editing too of course.</p>

<p class=a>Here is an example of what is done in sound editing during the
production of a television show or film. In the next part we will run you
through a few of those techniques in Audacity.</p>

<p class=qr>The Path of Sound in Film and TV Postproduction</p>
<p class=a>Film and TV crews have at least two people present that take care of
recording sound during principal photography of a show. Principal photography
is usually shooting the scenes with actual live actors or real backgrounds by
the way.</p>

<p class=qr>Sound in Principal Photography</p>
<p class=a>The first person is the boom pole operator. The boom pole is an
extendible stick with a microphone attached to it. This is used to capture
dialogue either during filming or not. When not filming, it might be capturing
off-scene dialogue or retakes of lines that the actors flunked during actual
film takes. The more expensive the show is and the more time there is to do the
work, the more people will resort to <i>looping</i> those takes, which is
recording those lines in a sound studio environment instead of a film studio
or location.</p>
<p class=a>The second person is the sound mixer, who usually sits in a place
farther off from the shooting and records the sound captured by the boom pole
operator, either via cable or wireless devices to tape,optical disks or hard
drive.</p>
<p class=a>This is the raw sound material of a show. It is called
<b>production sound</b> and the only desirable parts it usually contains are
dialogue and body sounds. In post production, depending on the complexity,
budget size and time, almost everything you hear except for the dialogue and
some body sounds, are added later during ...</p>

<p class=qr>Post Production</p>
<p class=a>This is where most of the stuff we'll be describing for Audacity
will happen. You've got the recording. Now what ?</p>
<p class=a>After the visual part of the show is cut, the first of which usually
isn't the final one, it is handed to the sound editor. In TV shows, you'll
usually have one or two people for this, for major film productions a whole
bunch more, for which tasks will be subdivided on a finer level.</p>

<p class=qr>Raw sound - Cleanup time</p>
<p class=a>No shows do without film edits and many have plenty of them.</p>
<p class=a>Scenes may be shot with with one or more cameras and mics. Actors
might have flunked their lines and picking up shooting prior to the mistake
might be chosen or the entire sequence reshot. The film editor may have chosen
parts from different takes for the cut of the scene. The action might be
moving along at the wrong pace and the film editor shortened or stretched
parts of a scene.</p>
<p class=a>The sound editor makes sure transitions between cuts are smooth.
He or she removes undesired sounds, such as breathers of the same person that
overlap from one film edit to the next.</p>
<p class=a>Material is cut away that contains unwanted sounds, such as creaking
chair legs and sharp impacts of objects on tables and floors. Some of these may
require looping of dialogue in the studio, because the noise may have been
intolerable. Also, material may sometimes be denoised. The most sophisticated
methods remove the whirring of the camera motors from takes. It is used as
sparingly as possible though.</p>
<p class=a>It's always desirable to get the best possible sound from the start,
which is the recording stage.</p>

<p class=qr>Adding stuff - the really big deal</p>
<p class=a>After this cleanup is complete, sounds are added.</p>
<p class=a>The first is <b>ambiance</b>. Just close your eyes and listen to the
sound around you. That's ambiance. Sophistication of ambiances rises with
budgets. From premixed to over a dozen tracks, you'll find it all in TV shows
and feature films. In any indoor scene with a lot of people in the background,
nobody except for the actors being filmed will actually talk. That flurry of
conversation is added later on.</p>
<p class=a>Next comes <b>foley</b>. These are clothes rustling (body sounds),
foot steps and objects being handled. People that have the ultimate edition of
Terminator 2 will know that all of Arnold Schwarzenegger's footsteps and rustle
of his leather clothing were created by a five foot woman. These people are
usually called foley walkers or foley artists.</p>
<p class=a>The foley editor then cleans these sounds, chooses the most fitting
takes and makes sure they all sync to the picture properly. The foley mixer
then does his/her thing.</p>
<p class=a>Next come <b>effects</b>. Foley are effects too, but they are a
special category and can best be described as live created studio effects.
Effects are usually more heavily edited and recorded from all kinds of places.
A lot of effects are created by layering sounds on top of each other, changing
their pitch and loudness, editing bits out and adding others.</p>
<p class=a>Many effects you'll hear are phone and door bells ringing, mobile
phone beeps, doors of houses and cars opening and closing, weapon shots, slaps,
car skids, machines of any kind, space ships flying around, explosions, to
name a few.</p>
<p class=a>For example, a friend of mine and I created the sound of a small
wooden rowing boat hitting a larger wooden sailing ship and scraping along its
side by pitching down a knock on a large wooden door for the impact of the
rowing boat and ship, and pitching down the sound of a skateboard rolling and
scraping along a halfpipe.</p>
<p class=a>The techniques required to properly handle sounds like these are
used in all kinds of productions. Audio books, music production, sound effects
creation ... you name it.</p>

<p class=a>So let's jump in to the fray and look at how you can handle your sounds in Audacity.</p>
